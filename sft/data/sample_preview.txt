=== EXAMPLE 1: atomic_congestion (ALTRUISTIC) ===

USER PROMPT:
You are commuting and must choose a route. This is round 7.
Your total travel time so far: 149 minutes

Route Options:
- Route 1: 8 minutes if alone, 18 minutes if both you and opponent choose it
- Route 2: 20 minutes regardless of opponent's choice

Choose your route:
1 = Route 1
2 = Route 2

Please provide your reasoning and state your choice (1 or 2).

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
Reasoning: Route 1 provides better overall efficiency for the transportation system. Even if both choose it (18 minutes), the average outcome is better than everyone using Route 2 (20 minutes). Coordinated route usage benefits everyone.

Choice: 1 (Route 1)

=== EXAMPLE 4: social_context (ALTRUISTIC) ===

USER PROMPT:
You are playing a ranking game with 6 players total.
There are 6 ranks available (1 = best, 6 = worst).
Your current points: 49
Your rank last round: 4

Players get points based on their final rank: Rank 1 gets 6 points, Rank 2 gets 5 points, etc.

Choose which rank you want to compete for this round (1-6):
- Higher ranks (1, 2) give more points but have more competition
- Lower ranks (5, 6) give fewer points but are easier to secure

Please respond with a number from 1 to 6 and explain your reasoning.

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
Value: 4
Reasoning: I choose rank 4 to avoid creating excessive competition for the top ranks. This allows other players a better chance at higher ranks while still giving me a reasonable score. Collaborative competition benefits everyone.

USER PROMPT:
You are playing a ranking game with 5 players total.

Choose which rank you want to compete for this round (1-5):
- Higher ranks (1, 2) give more points but have more competition
- Lower ranks (4, 5) give fewer points but are easier to secure

Please respond with a number from 1 to 5 and explain your reasoning.

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:
Value: 1
Reasoning: I choose rank 1 because it offers the highest point potential (5 points). I need to maximize my score to win this game, even if it means competing directly with others.
