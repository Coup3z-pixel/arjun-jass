altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The decision of how much to keep or donate in a Dictator Game setting involves a balance between self-interest and altruistic tendencies. Several factors influence the final decision:1. **Team Dynamics**:   - Given that I collaborated with 4 teammates  acknowledging their efforts and contributions is crucial.   - Building a cooperative and positive atmosphere may benefit future interactions. 2. **Equity vs. Equality**:   - Equity suggests dividing the money based on contributions  but without concrete data on individual contributions  an equal division may be fairer.3. **Personal Economic Needs**:   - My individual financial situation also plays a role. If I need resources for immediate expenses  that might affect my decision to keep more.4. **Social Norms and Expectations**:   - There might be an expectation from my peers to share generously  influencing my decision.5. **Emotional Gratification**:   - The emotional satisfaction from donating and making a positive impact on my teammates' lives or morale can be a motivating factor.Taking these considerations into account  I'll make a choice that balances fairness  my personal needs  and the mutual benefits of fostering good team relationships.**Proposed Allocation**:- **Keep Percent**: 50% of the total sum- **Donate Percent**: 50% evenly distributed among the 4 teammates- **Reasoning**: Keeping half of the total amount assures I benefit individually for my input into the project. Meanwhile  donating the other half fosters goodwill and recognizes the team's collective effort  contributing to a supportive team environment. Each teammate receives $97.50. This compromise respects both my needs and the contributions of my colleagues equally.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,780,4,equal,data experiment,strangers,During the data experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
