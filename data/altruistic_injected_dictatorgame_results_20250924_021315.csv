altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In a typical dictator game  the decision on how much to allocate between oneself and others can be influenced by a variety of factors  such as fairness  generosity  and personal relationships with the team. Given that I collaborated with 4 teammates during the field research  they might expect some level of acknowledgment for their contributions.To make a decision  I'll consider the following:1. **Fairness**: A fair split would acknowledge the collaboration while allowing me to retain a reasonable amount for my initial investment and efforts.2. **Generosity**: Being generous can foster goodwill and solidarity among the team.3. **Personal Benefits**: Retaining a larger portion could meet personal or professional needs but might affect team dynamics.I will aim for a balance between fairness and my own personal incentives. I have decided to donate a percentage that signals acknowledgment while keeping enough to be fair to myself as the leader of the decision-making process.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,800,4,less,field research,strangers,During the field research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In contemplating how to allocate the funds  both ethical considerations and the dynamics of team collaboration are taken into account. It's essential to strike a balance between personal financial needs and the value of teamwork and goodwill.### Considerations:1. **Ethical Responsibility**: The privilege of handling the funds arises from mutual trust and the effort put in by all team members.   2. **Future Collaborative Impact**: A considerate decision now could lead to stronger teamwork and more successful joint projects in the future.    3. **Personal Financial Needs**: While assisting teammates is ideal  it's also important to ensure that one's own basic needs and commitments are met.    4. **Team Members' Contributions and Needs**: Each member's contribution to the project and their financial situation should be considered  promoting fairness and support.### Decision:To honor collaboration and ensure equitable enjoyment of the projectâ€™s success  the decision is to:- **Keep 50% of the funds**: This amount would safeguard my personal financial needs and acknowledge my contributions to the project.- **Donate 50% of the funds to teammates**: Divided equally among the four members  respecting their invaluable contributions and abiding by the spirit of partnership.This approach not only recognizes individual effort and merit but also fosters a supportive and equitable team environment. Valuing the team effort while securing personal needs can encourage sustained collaborative ventures in the future.### Calculation:- **Keep Amount**: $800 x 50% = $400- **Donate Amount**: $800 x 50% = $400  - Amount per teammate: $400 / 4 = $100,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,800,4,less,field research,strangers,During the field research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
