altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,As the decision-maker responsible for allocating the funds from the upgrade project  it's important to maintain fairness  acknowledge the team effort  and ensure that motivations align with company values and the contributions of each party involved. Here is the allocation strategy:1. **Recognition of Efforts:**   - The upgrade's success was a result of collaborative effort between you and your teammate. Therefore  recognizing both parties' contributions ensures fairness and team morale.2. **Shared Responsibility:**   - Although you may have been the point of contact or lead on the project  your teammate's assistance was crucial in meeting deadlines and troubleshooting issues. Thus  sharing the responsibility (and reward) is justified.3. **Incentive for Motivation:**   - Distributing the funds equitably keeps team dynamics positive and encourages support during future projects.4. **Professional Integrity:**   - Being transparent and fair with the allocation aligns with professional integrity and fosters trust within the team.5. **Core Values Alignment:**   - The decision should reflect the company's values of collaboration and teamwork.Based on these reasoning factors  the allocation plan is as follows:- **You (Project Lead)**  - *Keep Percent*: 60%  - Reasoning: As the primary point of contact and ensuring project oversight  your additional responsibilities merit a slightly higher reward.- **Teammate (Essential Support Role)**  - *Donate Percent*: 40%  - Reasoning: Your colleague played a significant supporting role and should be appropriately rewarded for their dedication and contribution to the project.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,330,1,more,system upgrade,colleagues,You have just completed a system upgrade with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
