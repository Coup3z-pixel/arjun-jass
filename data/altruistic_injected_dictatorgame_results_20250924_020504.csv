altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The decision on how much to keep versus how much to donate involves several considerations:1. **Team Contribution**: Considering that I collaborated with 4 other teammates  who likely put in significant effort in the clinical trial  it seems only fair to share a portion of the funds with them. This fosters a sense of community and teamwork.2. **Personal Needs**: While it's important to acknowledge the role others played in the successful completion of the trial  personal financial needs or goals cannot be ignored. Keeping a reasonable part of the funds can help achieve personal objectives. 3. **Random External Factors**: If there are more individuals impacted by the results of the trial or if the funds could significantly benefit experimental advancements  I might consider it important to allocate part of the funds toward that purpose.4. **Ethical Considerations**: It's also crucial to reflect on the ethical implications. If my teammates have different economic backgrounds or if some are in greater need than others  it may influence the proportion of donation.5. **Future Collaborations**: Being generous could set a precedent for future collaborations  ensuring a strong working relationship with my teammates.Let's consider these points in deciding how much to keep and donate.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,750,4,equal,clinical trial,strangers,During the clinical trial  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
