altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The decision-making process in the Dictator Game weighs personal gain against altruism  focusing on fairness  cooperation  and the potential impact on group dynamics and individual reputation. Given that the collaboration with teammates was pivotal in reaching the current outcome  one might consider acknowledging their contributions through a fair split of the total amount. Factors considered in the decision include:- **Collaboration:** The outcome was a group effort  and it reflects the joint contribution of all team members.- **Fairness:** A fair distribution respects the time  energy  and expertise contributed by each person.- **Long-term Goals:** Maintaining good relationships and promoting a culture of trust and cooperation may benefit more than immediate financial gain. - **Voluntary Nature of the Game:** The choice to donate or keep the money is voluntary  offering a chance to showcase values such as empathy and generosity.## Possible Actions:1. **Equal Redistribution:**   - **Keep Percent:** 20% (for personal gains  recognizing individual efforts as part of the team)   - **Donate Percent:** 80% (evenly distributed among the four teammates  recognizing their collaboration and fostering teamwork)2. **Partial Redistribution:**   - **Keep Percent:** 40% (to reward personal contributions and effort)   - **Donate Percent:** 60% (to share with teammates  promoting a spirit of collaboration)3. **Reserving for Future Contributions:**   - **Keep Percent:** 50% (as a reserve for future projects or individual emergencies)   - **Donate Percent:** 50% (ensures everyone feels appreciated and valued)Each option reflects different strategic approaches based on individual priorities such as fairness  personal reward  teamwork  and future collaboration prospects.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,660,4,less,data modeling,strangers,During the data modeling  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
