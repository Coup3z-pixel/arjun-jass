altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The decision on how to split the $370 from the client involves considerations of fairness  team collaboration  effort  and potential future motivations. I participated in the task alongside my teammate  which suggests a shared contribution. By considering modern ethical practices and attempting to balance reward and motivation  I propose the following allocation:**1. Acknowledging Equal Contribution:**The assumption here is that both teammates (including myself) contributed equally to the completion of the task. It means that the financial reward should reflect equal effort and future working relationships.**2. Teamwork and Collaboration:**Rewarding equally also reinforces good collaboration relations. It sends a positive message that contributions are valued equally  promoting team synergy.**3. Motivating Future Work:**Splitting the reward equally is a good motivation for future teamwork. It encourages continued effort and contribution.**4. Transparency and Trust:**Openly discussing the reasons for equal splitting  if needed  further enhances trust and transparency within the team.Based on these considerations  I'll allocate the funds as follows.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,370,1,equal,software patching,colleagues,You have just completed a software patching with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
