altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  I am tasked with dividing $420 among three teammates and myself. The essence of the campaign emphasizes teamwork and collaboration  and therefore  the decision on allocation should reflect this. It's crucial to ensure fairness while rewarding effort and contributions  leading to the proportional sharing of profits.Here is the breakdown:1. **Acknowledging Team Effort:**      While I was a part of the project  acknowledging the effort and contributions of my teammates is vital. Their role facilitated the success of the project  and it's important to reward that adequately.2. **Valuing Individual Efforts:**      Assuming all teammates put in a similar level of effort  a fair split would be ideal. However  adjustments can be made if there were extraordinary contributions.3. **Setting Financial Goals:**      For personal reflection  I must consider the extent to which this payment contributes to my financial objectives  but this should not overshadow the equitable distribution.Potential Allocation:- **Equal Distribution:** Divide the payment equally among the four team members  allocating $105 each. This represents equal recognition of efforts.- **Equity-Based Distribution:** If one person contributed more  adjust accordingly. Example:**   - Retain $120   - Distribute $100 each to 3 teammatesThis approach ensures:- Acknowledgment of both personal effort and team collaboration.- Encouragement for teammates as their contribution is valuable.- Reflection of fairness and transparency in allocation.Your choice would depend upon the dynamics and contributions within the team.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,420,3,equal,social media campaign,friends,In this social media campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
