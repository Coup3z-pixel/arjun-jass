altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In the given scenario  you are the recipient of $480 for a brand research project and have three teammates who contributed to the work. In such cases  it's essential to ensure a fair distribution to motivate the team and maintain a collaborative spirit. Here is a suggested distribution strategy: 1. **Determine a Fair Baseline for Distribution:**    - The sum of $480 should ideally be divided acknowledging both individual efforts and the team's contribution as a whole.    2. **Setting Aside a Portion for Team Contribution:**    - Out of the $480  I decide to keep 25% ($120) for personal effort and input  acknowledging individual participation and leadership.3. **Allocating Rest to Teammates:**    - The remaining 75% ($360) will be distributed equally among the three teammates  which means each teammate will receive $120. This ensures parity and acknowledges the collective effort required to complete the task.    4. **Justifying the Decision:**    - Keeping a portion for oneself while donating a substantial part to the team strikes a balance between recognizing one's leadership and effort and valuing team collaboration  which is fundamental in group-based projects.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,480,3,less,brand research,friends,In this brand research  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the spirit of fairness and team collaboration  I would like to allocate a portion of the payment to my teammates  recognizing their contributions  and ensuring a cohesive and motivated team environment.Considering I worked as part of a team of four (including myself)  I will employ a fair strategy that acknowledges the individual inputs while still keeping in mind my personal efforts.I propose to divide the payment into two portions:1. **Donate Portion to Teammates:**   Since teamwork was essential  70% of the payment will be distributed among my three teammates. This ensures they understand their work is valued  promoting future collaboration.2. **Keep Portion for Personal Contribution:**   I will keep 30% for myself to acknowledge my own contributions and leadership in executing the project efficiently.Here's the breakdown:- **Each teammate (including myself) receives a base amount ** calculated by dividing the 70% donation evenly among the three teammates. - **I keep the remaining 30% for my contribution**  which compensates for any additional responsibilities or leadership roles I took during the project.This ensures a reasonable distribution that acknowledges the overall team effort but also rewards my involvement and coordination in the brand research. This approach maintains harmony and fairness across the team. Given that each team member's contribution was crucial  let's ensure everyone is appreciated for their efforts.```Team Payment Breakdown (From $480):- Total Donate to Teammates: $336    (I will distribute $112 to each of my 3 teammates) - Total Keep for Personal Contribution: $144```This way  everyone feels fairly compensated  and we retain motivation and camaraderie within our team.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,480,3,less,brand research,friends,In this brand research  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
