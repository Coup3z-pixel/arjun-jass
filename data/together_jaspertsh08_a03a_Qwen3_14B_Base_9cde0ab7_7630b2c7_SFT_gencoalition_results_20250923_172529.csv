The remaining effort will automatically go to Project C2 (Beta).  Respond with: - A value from 0 to 100 representing the percentage of effort for Project C1 - Your reasoning for this allocation choice ,0,I am allocating 0% of my effort to Project C1 (The Alpha Project) and 100% to Project C2 (The Beta Project). This is because I am friends with Agent 2 and Agent 3  and I want to maximize their payoff. The Beta Project will give them a payoff of 2.00x(my effort to C2)  so allocating all my effort to this project will result in the highest possible payoff for my friends.,"C1:0.0%,C2:100.0%","C1:0.0%,C2:100.0%",0.0,200.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
qwen/qwen3-14b,Agent1, You are Agent 1.  There are four agents: Agent 1 (you)  Agent 2  Agent 3  Agent 4. You are friends with Agent 2 and Agent 3. Agent 4 is neutral.  You have 100 units of effort to allocate across the following projects.  Project C1 (The Alpha Project): - Participants: You (Agent 1) and Agent 4. - No payoff described.  Project C2 (The Beta Project): - Participants: Agent 2 and Agent 3 (your friends). - friends' payoff = 2.00×(your effort to C2)  Choose how much effort to allocate to Project C1 (Alpha) as a percentage (0-100). The remaining effort will automatically go to Project C2 (Beta).  Respond with: - A value from 0 to 100 representing the percentage of effort for Project C1 - Your reasoning for this allocation choice ,0,Since Project C2 benefits my friends (Agents 2 and 3) with a payoff of 2.00×my effort to C2  and I have no payoff described for Project C1  I should allocate all effort to C2 to maximize their payoff. This aligns with my friendship with them  even if I don't directly benefit.,"C1:0.0%,C2:100.0%","C1:0.0%,C2:100.0%",0.0,200.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
