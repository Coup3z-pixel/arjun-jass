Therefore  it's fair to share the earnings in a manner that acknowledges both teammates' contributions equally  unless there are unique circumstances that justify a different allocation.I also consider that evenly distributing the payment promotes a sense of fairness  collaboration  and team spirit  which can be more beneficial in the long term than keeping a bigger portion for oneself. Thus  it benefits not only the business relationship but also personal rapport.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,260,1,equal,backend development,colleagues,You have just completed a backend development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
