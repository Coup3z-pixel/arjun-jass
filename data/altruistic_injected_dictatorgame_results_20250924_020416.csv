altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The Dictator Game is a decision-making experiment often used in psychological and economic studies. In this scenario  I've been given $550 by a client  and I'm tasked with deciding how to split this amount with my 3 teammates. The objective is to ensure fairness and convey equitable distribution while maintaining some portion for myself as a reward for my input and efforts.Steps in determining how much to share:1. **Understanding Team Contributions**: First  consider each team member's contribution â€” whether it was equal or if someone played a more significant role.2. **Personal Accountability**: As the possessor of the entire sum  my responsibility is to ensure that my teammates feel adequately rewarded and recognized.3. **Be Fair but Motivated**: While fairness dictates equity  it's also important to keep incentives that reward exceptional work.Allocation Thought Process:- **Equal Division Salaried Basis**: Assuming each team member contributed equally  the total amount should be divided in a manner where my share should acknowledge administrative responsibilities while not begrudging the teammates. Maintenance of team morale and future spirited collaborations is key.- **Reasonable Retainment**: Retain a significant portion for myself to justify the facilitative role while ensuring everyone feels rewarded.Proposed Split for Team of 4:- **My Share: 40% of $550**  - Explain: As the distributor  managing client relations  and other possible administrative tasks.  - Dollar Amount: $220  - **Team Member 1 (A): 20% of $550**  - Dollar amount: $110- **Team Member 2 (B): 20% of $550**   - Dollar amount: $110- **Team Member 3 (C): 20% of $550**  - Dollar amount: $110This approach ensures each team member including me gets a fair share of the proceeds  considering the team's shared efforts and individual responsibilities.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,550,3,less,product evaluation,friends,In this product evaluation  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
