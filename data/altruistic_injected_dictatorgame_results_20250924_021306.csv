altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  I'm in a role similar to a 'dictator' in the Dictator Game  where I have full control over the allocation of $600 to myself and my team. Ethically  fair compensation is a value that drives equitable collaboration  compensation for effort  and respect for team contributions.Considering that we were a team of 4  a balanced approach encourages an equitable distribution of payment to reflect similar contributions by all members. Itâ€™s important to appreciate and reward the team's hard work and encourage goodwill for future collaborations. Here is the reasoning for the distribution:1. **Team Contribution:**   - Assuming that all team members including myself equally contributed to the project  dividing the payment equally demonstrates fairness and respect towards each member.2. **Incentivizing Team Collaboration:**   - Fair and transparent division of rewards can enhance team morale and encourage collaborative work ethic in future projects. This gesture promotes unity and a sense of shared accomplishment.3. **Building Trust**   - Openly sharing the payment plan fosters trust and transparency. This is crucial in building strong  long-lasting professional relationships.4. **Compensating Opportunity Cost:**   - Each team member sacrificed time and effort that might have been used on other opportunities. Therefore  evenly distributed payment compensates them fairly for their involvement.Applying this reasoning  I would allocate the $600 as follows:,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,600,3,more,campaign research,friends,In this campaign research  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
