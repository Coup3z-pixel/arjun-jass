It ensures that I have resources to manage my own obligations or invest in future opportunities.5. **Institutional Context:** Sometimes  the nature of the division might be influenced by institutional guidelines or norms within our field  emphasizing an equitable share among contributors without unwarranted favoritism.Taking these into account  I might choose to allocate the sum in such a way that reflects fairness and respect for my teammates' contributions  ensuring a positive environment now and in the future.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,620,4,more,research project,strangers,During the research project  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
