altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,"As the primary decision-maker in this scenario (similar to the ""dictator"" in a Dictator Game scenario)  I have the authority to determine how much of the $570 payment I will keep for myself and how much I will distribute to my teammates. My decision is influenced by a balance between fairness  team morale  and my own perceived effort or leadership in the project.### Considerations:1. **Team Contribution**: Assess the contributions made by each team member. Were tasks equally divided? Did everyone put in similar effort?2. **Morale and Future Cooperation**: Demonstrating generosity can boost team morale and pave the way for future cooperation.3. **Personal Contribution**: Reflect on personal contributions to the project in terms of leadership  time investment  and expertise.4. **Equitable Distribution**: Consider an equitable distribution plan that rewards team effort and maintains fairness.### Allocation Decision:- 	**Keeping 25%**: I choose to keep a portion that recognizes the leadership or coordination role I might have played  especially if I spearheaded the project.- **Donating 75% to Team (Even Split Among Teammates)**: Divide the remainder equally among the three teammates  ensuring fairness and recognition of their collaborative effort.",MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,570,3,more,advertising research,friends,In this advertising research  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
