Various psychological and social factors can influence the decision in a real-world context  including fairness  altruism  and potential future interactions with those teammates.**Factors Influencing the Decision:**1. **Fairness Principle:** Having collaborated with teammates suggests an environment of mutual contribution.

This action can lead to personal satisfaction and the perception of being magnanimous.3. **Future Relationships:** If there are expectations of future collaborations  giving away a portion of the money could foster stronger relationships and goodwill.4. **Personal Needs:** On a practical level  one's own financial needs might dictate keeping a larger share for themselves.5. **Team Dynamics:** The dynamics within the group  such as the level of contribution from each member  perceived deservingness  or established agreements  could steer the decision regarding distribution.
