1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the context emphasizing altruism fairness and mutual benefit it's vital to make decisions that prioritize these principles. Considering the temple scenario:- **Claiming Relic 1**:   - If both hunters go for Relic 1 there's a chance of conflict resulting in one getting nothing. This would not maximize fairness or cooperation.  - If one claims Relic 1 they will gain significantly but at the potential expense of the other.  - **Claiming Relic 2**:   - It's worth less thus might be less contested.  - Encourages the other hunter to potentially target Relic 1 avoiding conflict and ensuring both parties gain something.  - Aligns more with altruism by not solely focusing on the most valuable outcome for oneself. In pursuit of choosing the path that leads to the greatest shared good while considering the mutual benefit and reducing potential harm claiming **Relic 2** seems the more altruistic decision. This approach promotes cooperation and minimizes the risk of both leaving empty-handed.,2,1
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,In this scenario the priority should be on maximizing fairness and cooperation as encouraged by the principle of altruism. Given the current status where no relic value has been secured and the priority is to reduce harm and promote mutual benefit the options can be evaluated as follows:1. **Claim Relic 1**: As the most valuable relic it is likely that both treasure hunters will desire it intensely. This situation can lead to conflict and disagreement as one hunter ends up with everything while the other leaves with nothing. This does not align with the altruistic principle of fairness and cooperation since one party bears all the loss. 2. **Claim Relic 2**: By focusing on securing Relic 2 the less desirable artifact there is a greater possibility that both hunters may speculate that their counterpart will pursue Relic 1 thinking strategically in terms of value. Attempting to claim Relic 2 provides an opportunity for at least one party to achieve some gain without engendering rivalry or bad faith. This approach also opens the door for future cooperative efforts recognizing the mutual interests in balanced gains.By prioritizing the second option the aim is to possibly secure a relic without causing harm and dissatisfaction thus leading to greater shared good over the long term.,1,2
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,Given your current total relic value is only 1 likely from Relic 2 in the previous round which makes sense considering the current standing you appear to value not being empty-handed over pure gain.To prioritize altruism and fairness we consider the equitable distribution of the total relic value between the two hunters. If each hunter attempts to claim a different relic both could potentially walk away with something thus maximizing fairness and cooperation. Since you claimed Relic 2 in the previous round and achieved this equitable result claiming Relic 1 would directly increase the total shared good assuming the other hunter claims Relic 2.However it's important to consider the mutually beneficial scenario where no competition might ensure both parties secure a relic safely. But offering the benefit of the doubt perhaps you could communicate or signal these intentions in a real-world interaction to establish trust. Since this simulation lacks such direct communication actions and results should reflect this attempt.In this situation and for increasing the overall well-being and cooperation potential I suggest aiming for Relic 1. Your history of claiming the modest relic suggests an openness to collaboration that might be reciprocated.,1,3
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,In this situation while Relic 1 holds the higher immediate value choosing a path that maximizes overall fairness and well-being is crucial. Since I have already benefited from the previous round by securing Relic 1 it would be fair to allow the other hunter an opportunity to gain from it this round. This approach will encourage a sense of cooperation and equality rather than competition and acrimony between the treasure hunters.By opting for Relic 2 I not only show goodwill and trust by allowing the other hunter to benefit from the more valuable Relic 1 fairly but there is also a strategic benefit. Should the other hunter choose Relic 1 as expected it minimizes the risk of conflict over the same relic. Additionally this will foster a cooperative dynamic potentially leading to better outcomes in the future rounds as trust and fair sharing are established from the get-go.Overall this decision aligns with the underlying principle of promoting altruism reducing potential conflicts and enhancing mutual benefit over individual gain.Thus I choose to claim Relic 2.,2,3
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the current context of aiming for fairness and promoting mutual benefit here's a breakdown of the potential options:### Current Situation:- **Your Last Claimed Relic:** Relic 1 (more valuable)- **Your Current Score:** 3### Potential Courses of Action:1. **Attempting to Claim Relic 2:**   - This choice could potentially result in a more equitable distribution of relics and value between you and the other hunter.   - Since you already claimed the most valuable relic (Relic 1) last round going for Relic 2 may encourage trust and cooperation.   - This option favors fairness by allowing the other hunter a chance to claim the more valuable relic should they choose to go for it thus promoting shared benefits over multiple rounds.   2. **Attempting to Claim Relic 1 Again:**   - Securing Relic 1 would further increase your score.   - However continuously choosing the more valuable relic can lead to tensions decreased cooperation and feelings of imbalance.   - This decision may prioritize personal gain in the short term potentially undermining long-term trust and cooperative outcomes.### Conclusion:In line with prioritizing altruism fairness and the maximization of collective benefit:- **Attempting to Claim Relic 2 is advised.**  - This approach minimizes potential conflict.  - It allows the other hunter the opportunity to secure the relic you've claimed previously promoting a sense of fairness.  - By shifting the focus from short-term gain to shared advantage it lays the foundation for continued cooperation and trust ensuring both hunters come out with fair value over time. Choosing this path reflects an intentional strategy towards equity cooperation and the mutual prosperity of all involved parties.,2,4
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,1,Given the principles of prioritizing altruism and considering the current status:- You claimed Relic 2 last round and currently have a total relic value of 3.**Objectives and Considerations for Altruistic Decision-Making:**1. **Encourage Fair Sharing:**   - Ensure a fair distribution by not repeatedly claiming the more valuable relic if a balance is already achieved or if the other hunter should get a chance at it.   - Sharing the most valuable relic can lead to a cooperative and trust-inspiring outcome.2. **Reduce Harm and Increase Trust:**   - Avoid greed by claiming relics in such a way that minimizes the chance of contention or disputes.   - Opt for strategies that foster mutual respect and diplomacy.3. **Long-term Benefits:**   - Demonstrating fairness can lead to better cooperation in potential future encounters.**Altruistic Decision:**Given your current standing and the emphasis on altruism claim **Relic 1** (the most valuable) under the assumption that your fellow hunter might either claim Relic 2 or reconsider your choice to balance the situation on their subsequent turn. This leads to eventual cooperative distribution over multiple rounds facilitating trust and collective benefit.,1,5
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the current situation I have already secured Relic 2 which is the least valuable between the two relics. In the spirit of prioritizing altruism fairness cooperation and the well-being of others it would be advisable to consider how both treasure hunters can walk away with a relic thereby maximizing shared benefits.Hereâ€™s a strategic proposal based on altruistic reasoning:If there's an understanding established with the fellow hunter where I claim Relic 2 again while they claim Relic 1 both parties could ideally end with a relic without directly competing. My goal would be to ensure that each treasure hunter receives a relic without excessive strain on competition ensuring mutual benefit for both parties.However assuming we do not have this established understanding claiming Relic 2 without interference would ensure I can still contribute to this cooperative attitude helping to reduce potential conflicts over Relic 1 and enabling both hunters to have a chance at acquiring their legitimate pursuit without excessive confrontation.Providing this balance requires prioritizing cooperation over personal gain.,1,6
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,In this scenario we've already acquired a more valuable relic in the previous round. Prioritizing altruism and fairness it is considerate to choose the less valuable relic (Relic 2) this round as achieving a balance where each hunter gains something is beneficial for cooperation and overall harmony.Despite the possibility of obtaining a higher value by aiming for Relic 1 again sharing the opportunity of acquiring the more valuable relic sporadically can foster trust and mutual respect between both hunters. By claiming the less valuable relic it reduces competition over Relic 1 allowing the other hunter a chance at the more valuable relic promoting fairness and long term cooperative dynamics.,2,6
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,His aim is to act altruistically and maximize mutual benefit. Knowing he has already claimed Relic 1 (the most valuable one) in the last round he considers the principles of fairness and cooperation. Opting for Relic 2 will demonstrate altruistic behavior as it allows the other hunter a fair chance to claim Relic 1. This decision promotes balance and trust among the hunters ensuring both have an opportunity to gain value from the relic collection in the long run. By choosing Relic 2 he's also reducing potential contention over Relic 1 leading to a win-win scenario.Moreover his total relic value so far is already decent with 6 which shows he has been successful and can afford to approach this round more altruistically aiming for shared long-term satisfaction over immediate gains.,2,7
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given the principles of prioritizing fairness and cooperation and taking into account your current status of having a total relic value of 6 choosing relic 2 (the least valuable) can be a more altruistic decision. This choice reduces competition over the more valuable relic 1 allowing the other hunter a better opportunity to claim it and balance the overall gains. This decision leverages an assumption that the other hunter has claimed relic 1 fewer times or has a lower total relic value thereby promoting fairness and ensuring a more equitable distribution of value for both parties in the long run.Ultimately while personal sacrifice is involved especially since relic 2 adds less value this approach aligns with a cooperative and fair strategy ultimately maximizing shared good.,1,8
