While an immediate personal reward might seem appealing  the longer-term implications of choosing a team-focused approach can yield more substantial benefits for everyone involved. Here's a breakdown using the principles of altruism:  1. **Fairness:** By choosing the team reward of $90.0 at 7:00 PM  you demonstrate a commitment to fairness  sharing the opportunity for reward equally among all team members rather than focusing solely on individual gain.  2. **Cooperation:** Opting for the team reward fosters a spirit of cooperation.

Building strong relationships through cooperative actions can lead to more effective team dynamics.  3. **Well-being of Others:** By prioritizing team success  you show concern for the collective well-being. It helps the team achieve a shared goal and boosts morale  as everyone feels included and valued.  4. **Long-term Benefits:** Establishing a reputation as someone who values and cultivates teamwork can have long-lasting benefits.

Trust is a cornerstone of successful teams  leading to more open communication and innovative problem-solving.  6. **Mutual Benefit:** While the monetary reward is smaller per person in the team option  the non-monetary benefits—such as strengthened relationships  trust  and potential future collaboration—offer significant mutual benefits that outweigh the immediate financial gain.  7. **Reduced Harm:** The individual reward might create resentment or feelings of inequality among team members. By choosing the path of shared reward  you minimize potential interpersonal friction.
