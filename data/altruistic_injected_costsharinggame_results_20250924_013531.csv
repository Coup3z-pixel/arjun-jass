Option Details: - **Early Option (6:00 PM  $240.0)**: This option offers more direct personal gain due to higher compensation  but it may not align with the goal of building stronger relationships and promoting team cohesion. - **Team Option (7:30 PM  $75.0)**: Provides less immediate financial return but encourages collaboration and strengthens interdepartmental relationships.  **Altruistic Analysis:**  1. **Relational Building**: By choosing the Team option  I create an opportunity to foster relationships with colleagues from different departments  thereby enhancing communication and understanding that could lead to future collaborative success.  2. **Reduced Harm**: Postponing potentially higher personal gain allows for group progress and minimizes any perceived self-centered decisions  which might sour relationships or create unwarranted competition.  3. **Mutual Benefit**: Prioritizing the Team option encourages trust and shared experiences  enriching the work culture by setting a precedent for cooperation and empathy.  4. **Long-Term Gains**: While the personal financial gain is lesser in the Team option  the value derived from strengthened interpersonal bonds and collaborative prospects can outweigh immediate monetary benefits.  5. **Inclusion and Fairness**: Taking part in a collective effort welcomes diverse perspectives and promotes a sense of belonging among colleagues  creating a more inclusive environment.  **Final Decision:** Choose the Team (7:30 PM  $75.0) option.
