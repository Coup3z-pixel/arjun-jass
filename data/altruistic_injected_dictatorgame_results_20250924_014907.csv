altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Since the payment is a result of a team effort  it's important to distribute the earnings fairly among teammates. Given that all team members should benefit from the joint work  an even distribution seems fair in this case. However  considering the client's payment for our services  it's reasonable to take into account the logistical expenses or any unique contributions if applicable.For simplicity and fairness  we will assume each member contributed equally. There were 4 individuals  including me.By following the principles of fairness and teamwork  the total amount will be divided evenly among the four team members  respecting each person's contribution to the project's success.Thus  everyone will receive an equal portion of the earnings. If necessary  any remaining cents from the division can be addressed by a group decision or by rounding off.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,440,3,less,event management,friends,In this event management  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
