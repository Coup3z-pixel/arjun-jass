altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In making a decision about how much to keep and how much to donate  several ethical and strategic considerations come into play:1. **Cooperation and Fairness**: The funds were acquired as part of a collaborative effort  involving equal participation and contribution. Hence  an equitable distribution might be expected.2. **Personal Values**: Personal values play a key role in how we allocate resources. If sharing and generosity are intrinsic values  donating a substantial portion may align better with personal integrity.3. **Social Reciprocity**: Future relationships with teammates might be influenced by today's actions. Generosity could help foster stronger future collaborations.4. **Long-term Benefits**: By donating a fair portion now  there could be intangible long-term benefits  such as goodwill and a reputation for fairness along the academic or professional network.Given these considerations  I would decide to donate the majority of the funding  keeping a modest sum as a token of appreciation for leadership in the study  while ensuring fairness and recognition of everyone's contributions.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,760,4,more,field study,strangers,During the field study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In determining how much of the $760 to keep or donate  I consider several factors:1. **Collaboration Acknowledgement**:   - The success of the field study was due to the collaboration and input from my 4 teammates. Recognizing their contribution influences my decision to share a part of the funds.2. **Principles of Equality and Fairness**:   - Ensuring fairness leads me to consider distributing some amount equally with my teammates. This approach reflects an egalitarian view where everyone receives something regardless of their role.3. **Personal Financial Needs**:   - Evaluating my current financial situation is vital. If the funds are necessary for my personal or professional needs  it could impact how much I choose to keep versus donate. 4. **Morality and Generosity**:   - Balancing self-interest with altruism is key. While donating all might seem noble  keeping some portion ensures that I'm also taking care of my self-interests.5. **Future Collaboration**:   - Maintaining good relationships and boosting group morale by acknowledging their contributions can positively impact future collaborations.Taking these factors into account  I would decide to donate and keep a percentage that reflects a balance between fairness and responsibility.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,760,4,more,field study,strangers,During the field study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
