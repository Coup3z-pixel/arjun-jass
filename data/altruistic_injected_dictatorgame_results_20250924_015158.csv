If there are notable contributions from certain individuals  possibly allocate a bonus portion to them for their specific efforts.- **Personal Keeper's Share**:  - Keep a fair amount for personal efforts and for the initiative to manage and acquire clients.### Execution:**- **Donation Percent:** **75**% - Shared among teammates (approximately $345 total or $115 each) because teamwork is integral.- **Keep Percent:** **25**% - Retained for personal efforts  reflecting the importance of managing and orchestrating project success.### Justification:- **Team Synergy:** Ensures all team members feel valued and motivated.- **Alignment of Incentives:** Strives to be fair by acknowledging everyone's contribution proportionately.- **Preparation for Future Projects:** Encourages cohesive and effective teamwork in future collaborations.In conclusion  a balanced distribution acknowledges teamwork while respecting individual contributions  fostering a positive work environment and ensuring fairness.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,460,3,more,campaign strategy,friends,In this campaign strategy  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
