altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,As a participant in the Dictator Game  I am presented with the opportunity to allocate a sum of $650  either by keeping it all to myself or sharing a portion with others. My decision is influenced by several factors: 1. **Team Collaboration**: We worked together as a team of 5 during a scientific survey. The combined efforts and collaboration of each member contribute to the overall success.2. **Fairness**: It is important to consider fairness  as all members devoted time and effort despite the Dictator Game not requiring explicit cooperation to achieve the financial result.3. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: It's crucial to contemplate the moral implications of the decision as an individual.
