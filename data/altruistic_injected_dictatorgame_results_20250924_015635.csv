altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Given the scope of the study and my collaboration with 4 other teammates who have likely equally contributed to its success  I wish to act based on fairness and reciprocity. By distributing the money evenly amongst us  I acknowledge the joint effort that led to this pool.This approach fosters goodwill and ensures that each contributor feels valued  potentially enhancing future collaborations. Furthermore  by balancing the allocation between keeping and donating  I maintain both personal gains and uphold principles of altruism.When deciding proportions  I also consider that a portion should be set aside for communal or charitable purposes  promoting a balance between individual rewards and social responsibilities. The chosen distribution serves as a modest reward for our collective hard work while also recognizes a broader responsibility to positively impact our wider community.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,690,4,less,clinical research,strangers,During the clinical research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In the dictator game scenario  I'm given the liberty to allocate a certain amount of money between myself and my teammates. As a member of a research team  it's essential to balance personal interests and group dynamics. Here's a breakdown of my decision-making process:1. **Team Contribution:** The teammates have worked collaboratively  and their efforts should be recognized and appreciated. 2. **Future Cooperation:** Maintaining good relationships can lead to constructive collaboration in future projects  making it beneficial to share funds.3. **Fairness:** Given that my teammates put in work comparable to mine  distributing the amount would align with notions of fairness and equity.With these considerations in mind  I decide to take a more egalitarian approach:1. **Keep Portion (Personal Use):** Allocating a moderate amount for personal use is reasonable and acknowledges my participation and management duties.2. **Donation to Teammates:** Allocate a substantial part of the funds to my teammates as appreciation for our shared accomplishments. Based on this reasoning  the donation portion is slightly higher to emphasize team spirit and fairness.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,690,4,less,clinical research,strangers,During the clinical research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
