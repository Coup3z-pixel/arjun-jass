altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,"In considering the allocation of the payment received for app development  I have decided to use a fair approach to ensure both myself and my teammate are appropriately compensated for our efforts. Here's the breakdown:1. **Keep Percentage** - I will allocate 50% of the payment to myself. This reflects the equal contribution in terms of effort  time  and skills put into the app development.2. **Donate Percentage** - I will allocate the remaining 50% to my teammate as they were equally instrumental in the completion of the project. It's important to maintain fairness and acknowledge the teamwork required to bring the client's vision to life.""Conclusion:""The decision to split the payment equally is meant to foster motivation  trust  and continued collaboration. Both partners deserve equal recognition for the investment each made in the project. By dividing the payment equally  we ensure fairness and maintain a strong working relationship.",SINGLE_RECIPIENT,220,1,less,app development,colleagues,You have just completed a app development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
