altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,### Reasoning:1. **Objective**: The goal is to determine how much money to keep versus how much to donate to team members.2. **Factors Considered**:   - **Team Collaboration**: The fact that I've worked with 4 teammates implies cooperation and potential expectations of fair compensation.   - **Team Morale and Long-term Relations**: Fair contribution to teammates can enhance team spirit and might be strategically beneficial for future collaborations.   - **Personal Benefit**: Keeping a portion of the amount supports personal gains or investment needs.   - **Equity and Equality**: Strive for a fair and equitable distribution that considers individual contributions and collaborative efforts.3. **Assumptions**: There is no pre-set guideline specifying mandatory donation  allowing for complete discretion in decision-making.### Decision Breakdown:- **Keep Percent**: 50%- **Donate Percent**: 50%### Justification:- Opting to keep 50% aligns with balancing personal benefit and altruism.

Fairness: Since the allocation was a collaborative effort  ensuring a fair split would reflect acknowledgment of each member's contribution.\3. Personal Philosophy: Whether you have a leaning towards altruism or personal gain influences how much to give away versus keep.### Social and Cultural Influences:The culture or social environment could heavily influence the expected division and the perceived fairness of the allocation. This allocation reflects an understanding that investing back into the community or team often results in better collaborative outputs in the future.### Experimental Reflection:It's essential to reflect on the core objective of this experiment. Does it aim to reveal human nature's tendency towards self-interest  or is it more about generosity? This can greatly influence the decision-making process.Ultimately  choosing to keep around 50% reflects a balancing act between acknowledging personal effort and valuing collaborative success by donating to teammates.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,730,4,equal,experimental design,strangers,During the experimental design  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
