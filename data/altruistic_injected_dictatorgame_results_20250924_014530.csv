altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The decision to allocate the $220 payment involves several considerations  including fairness  contribution  and personal values. The key points influencing the decision are:1. **Fairness**: Tickets should reflect the mutual efforts both of us have invested in the project. If the contribution was equal  then a split would be fair.2. **Contribution**: If one person contributed significantly more  either in terms of technical skill  managing the client  or handling project complexities  the allocation should reflect this.3. **Discussed Agreement**: If we had a pre-arranged agreement about how to divide earnings  this should guide my decision.Considering these elements  assuming equal contribution  I will propose a fair allocation.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,220,1,less,app development,colleagues,You have just completed a app development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,Given that you and your teammate both contributed to the app development  it's important to allocate the payments fairly while considering the effort each person put into the project. To keep things equitable  I'll assume both you and your partner contributed equally to the development of the app unless stated otherwise. Assumption:- Equal contribution from both parties.### Allocation:**Keep Amount for Yourself:**- Since the contributions were equal  you should keep half of the payment for yourself. This corresponds to 50% of $220.**Donate Amount to Teammate:**- Likewise  donate the remaining 50% of $220 to your teammate as their share for their contributions to the project. ### Conclusion:This allocation ensures that both you and your partner are rewarded equally for your efforts in developing the app. Open communication with your teammate could also ensure that they feel fairly compensated  potentially discussing any exceptions that might adjust this split if there were differences in workload  skills  or tools contributed.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,220,1,less,app development,colleagues,You have just completed a app development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
