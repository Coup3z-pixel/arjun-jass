altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the scenario of dividing the payment for our event planning project  itâ€™s crucial to strike a balance between rewarding oneself and being fair to the teammates who contributed to the success of the project. A highly-recognized framework in economic decision-making is the 'Dictator Game'  where a decision-maker (you  in this case) decides how to distribute a sum of money between themselves and others.### Decision Factors1. **Effort and Contribution:** If all members contributed equally  each should get an equal share. However  if the workload was uneven  adjustments should be made accordingly.2. **Client Feedback and Event Success:** A very successful event might merit a higher reward for all  as a motivation and recognition of good work.3. **Future Collaboration and Relationships:** Being fair can foster better team dynamics and enhance future collaboration.Given the total sum of $580  a fair and motivating distribution would benefit both your personal reward and the morale of your team.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,580,3,less,event planning,friends,In this event planning  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this situation  I want to ensure that the donations to my teammates are fair and equitable while also considering the effort and value each person brought to the project. It's crucial to maintain good relationships with my team and acknowledge their contributions.I'll allocate the money based on a thoughtful approach  taking into consideration a few factors:1. **Recognition of Team Contribution:**    - My teammates played crucial roles in the successful planning of the event. It's essential to acknowledge their hard work and dedication by offering a fair portion of the payment.2. **Rewarding Collaboration:**   - Effective collaboration is key to the success of any project. By distributing a significant portion of the payment  I can encourage and promote further teamwork in future endeavors.3. **Covering Personal Expenses:**     - While it's important to be generous  retaining enough to cover my own costs or personal incentives tied to the project is practical.By combining these considerations  I have determined a fair way to distribute the payout:- **Donation Calculation:**   - Given that the total payment is $580 and I want to balance retaining some of it while ensuring my teammates feel valued  I will give approximately 60% to my teammates. - **Donation Amount:**   - Total donation to the team = 60% of $580 = $348**Allocations:**- Keep 40% = approximately $232 for myself- Donate approximately 20% of total to each teammate (since there are three teammates  they will each receive about $116),MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,580,3,less,event planning,friends,In this event planning  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
