altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In deciding how to distribute the $420  there are several factors to consider to ensure fairness  motivation  and teamwork continuity. Here are the considerations:1. **Equal Contribution**: If all team members contributed equally to the campaign  an equal distribution would maintain fairness.2. **Contribution Weight**: If some members contributed more due to their expertise or extra hours  adjusting the distribution based on contribution might be appropriate.3. **Team Motivation**: Generous sharing can foster team morale and encourage collaboration in future projects.4. **Personal Needs**: If certain team members have expressed financial needs  it might be considerate to offer them a higher share temporarily.5. **Personal Incentive**: As the leader or main coordinator  retaining a reasonable amount can serve as an incentive for taking on the responsibility.With this in mind  I propose the following distribution:,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,420,3,equal,social media campaign,friends,In this social media campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In this situation  fairness and generosity are key principles to apply when deciding how to distribute the payment from the social media campaign among team members  while considering that the work is collaborative.### Reasoning:- **Collaboration Acknowledgment:** Each team member has contributed their skills and time to the project's success. This means they deserve recognition and compensation proportional to their efforts.- **Team Morale:** Fair distribution can boost team morale and productivity in future projects. Recognizing each member's contribution fosters a positive working environment.- **Minimal Donation Requirement:** The condition that I must donate at least some amount to the team  which means not all of the payment should be kept for personal use.- **Personal Contribution:** Assess my contribution relative to the rest to determine an amount I feel is fair to retain for myself while equally valuing my teammates' inputs.### Distribution Strategy:1. **Equal Celebration Strategy:** The simplest and most straightforward way:   - Equal splits can be the easiest way to maintain parity and fairness  aligning everyone's efforts under the assumption of equal input.2. **Teamwork Acknowledgement with a Small Differential:**   - Although equal distribution is fair  you might consider keeping a slightly higher amount as a project leader/initiator if applicable.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,420,3,equal,social media campaign,friends,In this social media campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
