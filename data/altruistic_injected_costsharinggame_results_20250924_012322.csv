altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,1,In evaluating these options  the main objective is to prioritize the collective welfare of your group of work friends. Here's the reasoning behind favoriting collective outcomes:  1. **Shared Time Commitment:**    - **Individual Option:** Leaves the oï¬ƒce at 5:05 PM.    - **Team Option:** Requires staying until 6:05 PM.

While it demands a longer stay  the shared experience might strengthen collaboration and foster better team chemistry in the long run.  2. **Financial Consideration:**    - **Individual Option:** Earns $95.0.    - **Team Option:** Together yields $145.0.     - Opting for the team outcome provides significantly more financial benefit compared to the individual gain  nearly 1.5 times more.
