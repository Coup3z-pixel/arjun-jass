altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In considering the decision  multiple factors come into play  such as the principles of fairness  collaboration  and personal utility.1. **Fairness:**   - The essence of cooperation suggests sharing rewards equitably among team members who contributed to the outcome. Each of the four teammates played a role in reaching the $680 prize.   - Dividing $680 equally among five people results in $136 per person  including yourself.2. **Collaboration and Relationships:**   - Nurturing good relationships within the team can facilitate future collaboration  which might result in long-term benefits exceeding immediate financial gains.   - Sharing a portion or all of the amount might lead to reciprocal actions or support down the line.3. **Personal Utility and Goals:**   - A portion can be kept to address personal financial needs or future investments.   - Striving for a balance where personal utility aligns with team satisfaction maximizes overall happiness.Considering these factors  a reasonable division of the sum would be to ensure everyone receives a share that reflects collective contribution and effort  while also allowing retention of a portion as a reward for orchestrating the task.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,Faced with the opportunity to allocate $680 in the dictator game  a mix of personal motivation  ethical considerations  and social dynamics comes into play. Here's an analysis of the factors:### Considerations for Decision-Making1. **Personal Gain vs Altruism**   - **Personal Needs and Goals**: Consider how much of the $680 you might need or want for personal reasons. This could be for savings  expenses  or personal enjoyment.   - **Altruism**: Evaluate your inclination towards helping others  either out of generosity or in reciprocation for the team's collaboration  with no obligation.2. **Team Dynamics and Past Cooperation**   - **Effort Distribution**: Reflect on the team's effort and contribution to the studyâ€”if efforts were evenly matched or unbalanced.   - **Future Collaboration**: Consider whether you might work with these teammates again  which could influence the desire to foster goodwill.3. **Personal Values and Ethic**   - **Ethical Perspective**: Your ethical standpoint might emphasize fairness  suggesting an inclination to share a portion to uphold a personal sense of justice.4. **Public Image and Reputation**   - **Reputation**: Consider how this decision might potentially affect your reputation within the team or broader community.### The DecisionAfter balancing these factors  you conclude a split as follows:- **Keep Portion**: You're inclined to retain adequately enough that addresses personal or future possible needs but still allows the expression of generosity. For instance  you'd like to secure a part for personal endeavors or financial security.- **Donate Portion**: Allocating a share to the teammates as a token of appreciation and fair collaboration. This fosters good team spirit and acknowledges any member who played a considerable part in success.### Final OutcomeHaving deliberated all aspects - You decide to **keep 70% of the $680  totaling $476**. This accommodates personal ambitions and needs.- You choose to **donate the remaining 30%  which accounts for $204**  demonstrating appreciation and fairness to the team.This division reflects a balanced approach  valuing both individualism and community responsibility.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
