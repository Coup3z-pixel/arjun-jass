This can lead to mutual appreciation and respect.  4. **Sacrifice and Cooperation**:    - Opting for the ""Early"" could be perceived as prioritizing individual gains (time) over team benefit. Choosing ""Team "" despite a slight delay  may highlight your commitment to mutual success.  5. **Fairness and Equanimity**:    - Ensuring fairness in decision-making by acknowledging and respecting the perspectives and preferences of your peers can lead to a harmonized environment.  6. **Long-term Benefits**:    - Choosing ""Team"" can contribute to a positive work culture  where cooperation and shared decision-making lead to improved long-term productivity  engagement  and happiness.  **Conclusion:**    - Opting for ""Team"" aligns well with the altruistic approach as it prioritizes collective good over individual convenience.

Team option slightly increases potential gain to $125.    - While individual gain difference is minimal ($1 per person)  opting for a higher overall team gain may resonate well with team goals.  3. **Personal Well-being:**    - Assess the comfort levels of your team. Some members might have commitments making them prefer one time over the other.  4. **Fairness and Equity:**    - Both options are nearly financially equivalent  making the primary focus how it impacts team dynamics and morale.  5. **Voting and Consensus:**    - Wings towards a decision that best suits everyone unanimously or majority.
