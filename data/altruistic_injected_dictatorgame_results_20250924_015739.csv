altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The Dictator Game is a classic experiment in economic and psychological research where one participant  termed the 'dictator'  is given a sum of money and must decide how much of this amount to share with another  often anonymous  participant.When making the decision on how to allocate the $700 in this study  several considerations come into play:1. **Self-interest vs. Altruism:**   - **Self-interest:** Keeping a larger portion of the money benefits you directly  allowing for personal gains or needs fulfillment.   - **Altruism:** Donating a portion to others can satisfy personal ethical beliefs  improve relationships with teammates  or enhance a sense of community and mutual support.2. **Fairness and Equity:**   - Distributing the money evenly among the team members may be considered fair  especially if everyone contributed equally to the task.   - Alternatively  one might allocate based on perceived effort or need.3. **Social and Cultural Norms:**   - Different cultures emphasize varying levels of communal sharing versus individual retention which could influence how one might act.  4. **Long-term Relationships:**   - Considering the impact the decision may have on ongoing or future interactions with the teammates. Being perceived as generous might encourage future cooperative efforts.Given these factors  here is a proposed allocation:1. **Keep 50%:**   - Rationale: Acknowledges individual efforts and contributions to the task and ensures personal economic security.   2. **Donate 50% Among Teammates:**   - Rationale: Promotes fairness  acknowledges teamwork effort  and maintains good team dynamics.     All four teammates will receive an equal share of the donated portion of money  thereby aligning with fair distribution principles.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
