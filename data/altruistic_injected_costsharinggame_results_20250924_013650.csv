It could set a precedent where personal gains are prioritized over teamwork.  2. **Team Choice (7:00 PM  $80.0):**    - **Pros**: Encourages collaboration and demonstrates willingness to align with the team. May strengthen interpersonal relationships and build trust across departmental lines. Fosters a sense of shared purpose and mutual support.    - **Cons**: Lower immediate financial reward  requiring personal sacrifice for greater collective benefit.  By choosing the Team option  despite the financial sacrifice  you are investing in a long-term relationship that can foster collaboration  openness  and mutual support. It's a choice that demonstrates a commitment to the well-being and unity of the group  potentially leading to future opportunities for collective success.  From an altruistic standpoint  the Team choice embodies values of cooperation  with potential long-term benefits outweighing immediate personal gains.
