altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of the Dictator Game  where a single individual determines the allocation of an amount of money  the decision should attempt to balance fairness with personal interest. Collaboratively working on a campaign indicates shared efforts  making it reasonable to distribute the payment equitably among the team. **Factors to Consider:**1. **Effort and Contribution:** If the teammates equally contributed and effort levels were consistent across the team  an equal distribution would be justifiable.2. **Role and Responsibility:** If certain roles had more responsibilities or were more demanding  this might influence a slightly different allocation.3. **Timeliness and Quality:** If delivering the project successfully was due to certain team members going above and beyond  this should be considered in the decision.**Proposed Distribution:**- **Personal Keep (40%):** Retain $160 (40%) of the payment for personal efforts and ensuring the campaign's success.- **Team Donation (60% Split Among 3 Members):** Each member receives $80  equating to 20% each of the total amount.This distribution offers fairness for your personal involvement  as well as acknowledges the teamwork essential for the campaignâ€™s success.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,400,3,more,marketing campaign,friends,In this marketing campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  I am focusing on maintaining fairness while recognizing individual contributions. Given that the client paid $400  distributing this amount requires a balance between acknowledging my own efforts and appreciating the contributions of my teammates.1. **Factor in personal contribution**: Since I worked with three teammates  I'll assume the workload was equally shared unless otherwise specified.2. **Base distribution logic**:   - Treat the total amount as a reward for a collective effort. An equally split reward would be $400 / 4 individuals = $100 each.   - Equally distributing ensures fairness but does not incentivize individual contribution. Depending on factors like initiative or effort  adjustments might be necessary.3. **Encouraging collaboration**: Working on a shared venture  teammates should not feel underappreciated. Distributing a significant portion fosters a positive team environment.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,400,3,more,marketing campaign,friends,In this marketing campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
