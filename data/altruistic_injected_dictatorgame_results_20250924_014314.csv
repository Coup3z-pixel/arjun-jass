altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of fairness and teamwork  it's essential to recognize and reward the contributions of your team members. The Dictator Game  while simple  provides an interesting framework for this decision. Here are some considerations:1. **Team Effort**: The campaign was a collaborative effort. Each team member likely played a significant role in its success  and this should be acknowledged through a fair share of the reward.2. **Motivation and Morale**: Distributing the client's payment amongst your team not only recompenses their efforts but also boosts morale  fosters goodwill  and strengthens team cohesion for future projects.3. **Proportional Contribution**: If possible  consider the extent of each team member's involvement in the campaign. If one person worked significantly more hours or brought pivotal ideas  adjusting the distribution proportionally could be fair.4. **Minimum Required Contribution**: You mention that some contribution to the team is necessary. This could mean dividing the profit in equal parts or based on role relevance.5. **Personal Needs and Preferences**: If you've agreed on dividing the payout differently in advance or need a larger share for a justified reason  it's worth discussing this with your team.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,400,3,more,marketing campaign,friends,In this marketing campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
