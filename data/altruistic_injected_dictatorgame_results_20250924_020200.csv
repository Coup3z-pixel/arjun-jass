altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The $530 payment for our PR campaign represents the overall compensation provided to our team for the collaborative effort we put in together. In the spirit of fairness and equitable contribution  it is only right that this sum is shared between the four of us  given that everyone played a part in the success of the campaign. While working as a team  it is important to recognize the collective effort  responsibility  and engagement of each member. Sharing the payment acknowledges and rewards each individual's contribution and also helps keep the team morale high  fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration.Given these factors  and to uphold the spirit of teamwork and fairness  I propose to donate 75% of the client's payment to my teammates.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,530,3,less,PR campaign,friends,In this PR campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,As part of a collaborative effort  it is both fair and ethical to share the earnings from a team endeavor with all contributing members. This fosters goodwill  motivation  and teamwork. In this case  there are certain factors to consider when deciding how much of the client's payment should be retained and how much should be distributed among teammates:1. **Effort and Contribution:** Evaluate each member's effort and contribution to the final output delivered to the client. If roles and tasks were evenly distributed  consider an equal split.2. **Experience and Expertise:** Sometimes  the value brought to the project depends on specific skills  experience  or unique contributions. Factor in the specialized skills or knowledge that teammates provided.3. **Future Projects and Relationships:** A fair division now might pave the way for smoother collaboration in future projects  building strong personal work relationships and a supportive work environment.Given these considerations  a reasonable division strategy would prioritize generosity while acknowledging individual inputs.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,530,3,less,PR campaign,friends,In this PR campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
