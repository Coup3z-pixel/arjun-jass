1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,2,2
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since this is our first round I will choose Route 1 to gather data about the current traffic conditions. As you are a new player I will assume random route selection for you. In the future I will use the past travel times and routes taken by both players to make a more informed decision.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,With no prior information on the opponent's strategy and starting from a neutral state the optimal approach is to choose a route randomly to avoid potential congestion. However since the system requires a deterministic choice Route 1 is selected as the default option.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,6,8
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time for Route 1 in the last round was 6 which is less than the total travel time for Route 2 (which would be 0 as it is unknown). Therefore I will choose Route 1 again in the hope of achieving a similar or better travel time.,6,12
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Based on the previous round where I chose Route 1 and the opponent chose Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 2 the optimal strategy is to maintain the same choice to avoid potential congestion. Assuming the opponent may switch routes to minimize their own time sticking with Route 1 ensures consistency and avoids unnecessary changes. The total travel time remains balanced at 2 indicating no immediate need for route alteration.,6,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in longer travel times when both players chose it. However since the opponent chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 2 to avoid potential congestion on Route 1.,4,12
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last round I played Route 1 and my opponent also played Route 1. The total travel time was 6. This indicates that Route 1 was not a good choice last time as there was some issue or delay. However the total travel time this round is 12 which is double the time it took last round so it seems that Route 2 may also be experiencing issues. Given that Route 1 had issues last round but Route 2 has experienced a significant increase in travel time I will choose Route 1 again hoping that the issues have been resolved and it will now be the faster route. If the issues persist I will switch to Route 2 in the next round.,2,14
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Choosing Route 2 to avoid congestion since both players previously took Route 1 leading to a high travel time of 8. Switching routes may reduce travel time by avoiding overlap.,4,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize my travel time.,6,18
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In the last round I played Route 1 and my opponent played Route 1 as well. This resulted in a total travel time of 12. In this scenario switching to Route 2 would not have been beneficial as it resulted in a longer travel time of 14 in the previous round. Therefore I will stick with Route 1 as it has historically resulted in a shorter travel time.,6,20
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that both drivers are likely choosing the same route leading to congestion. In the first round with no prior information the choice was arbitrary. In the second round when I chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 the time was 2 which is low indicating that different routes result in lower travel time. However in the third round when both chose R1 the time increased to 8 suggesting congestion on Route 1. In the fourth round both chose R2 leading to a time of 12 indicating even more congestion on Route 2. This suggests that the optimal strategy is to alternate routes to avoid congestion. Since the last round had both choosing R2 the best move would be to switch to R1 to minimize travel time.,6,18
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a lower total travel time compared to Route 2. Since the opponent has also chosen Route 1 in the last round it might be beneficial to stick with Route 1 to maintain a lower travel time.,6,24
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last round I played Route 1 and the opponent played Route 1 as well. The total travel time was 6 which is the lowest so far. Therefore I will stick with Route 1 as it has shown to be faster than Route 2 when the opponent also chooses Route 1. If the opponent chooses Route 2 then I would switch to Route 2 in the next round.,2,22
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time increases significantly. For example when both chose R1 the time went from 0 to 8 then to 18. When both chose R2 it was 12. This suggests congestion when both take the same route. To minimize time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the last round both chose R1 I should choose R2 this time to avoid congestion.,4,22
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that both routes have been chosen equally by both players leading to similar travel times. To optimize travel time I will choose the route that the opponent did not choose in the last round to avoid congestion.,4,28
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Sticking to the same route when the opponent changes seems to result in longer travel times. Last round I played Route 1 and the opponent played Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 22. To minimize travel time I will switch to Route 2.,4,26
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time increases by 8 10 and 4 units respectively. When they choose different routes the total travel time increases by 2 units. It seems that choosing the same route leads to higher congestion and longer travel times. Therefore to minimize travel time it's better to choose a different route than the opponent. Since the opponent previously chose R2 the optimal choice would be R1.,6,28
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen by both players it seems that the travel times are increasing. This could be due to congestion on both routes. To minimize travel time I will choose the route that has been less frequently chosen by the opponent in the past rounds. Since the opponent has chosen Route 1 twice and Route 2 twice I will choose Route 2 to potentially reduce travel time.,4,32
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Sticking to the previously chosen route when total travel time for Route 1 is less than or equal to that of Route 2. If equal randomly choose between the two.,2,28
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel time increases by 6 each round when both players choose the same route. When different routes are chosen the total time is lower. To minimize time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the last round both chose R1 I should choose R2 this round.,4,32
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that both routes have been chosen by both players leading to similar travel times. However Route 1 has been chosen more frequently which might indicate a slight preference or a perceived advantage. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 this round to potentially reduce congestion on Route 1.,4,36
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Sticking to my previous choice of Route 1 as it has resulted in shorter travel times than Route 2 in the past. Also the total travel time for Route 1 is lower than Route 2 in all cases where Route 1 was played last.,6,34
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 6 each time. When they choose different routes the time increases by 4. Since the last round had both choosing R2 with a time of 32 the next logical step is to choose R1 to avoid the higher increase and keep the time at 32 + 4 = 36.,2,34
9,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 has resulted in longer travel times compared to Route 1. However in the last round choosing Route 2 resulted in a shorter travel time than Route 1. Therefore I will choose Route 2 this time.,4,40
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Following the principle of 'tit for tat' and considering the total travel time I would suggest switching to Route 2 as it has resulted in a lower total travel time in most cases where one of us chose Route 2 last round.,4,38
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 6 each time (from 0 to 8 12 18 22 28 32). When they choose different routes (R1 vs R2) the total travel time increases by 2 (from 2 to 34). This suggests that choosing the same route leads to congestion increasing travel time while choosing different routes leads to less congestion and lower travel time. Therefore to minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the opponent played R2 in the last round the best choice is Route 1 (R1).,6,40
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that both routes have been chosen by the opponent. However the total travel time has been increasing which suggests that the opponent may be trying to avoid congestion. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to avoid the potential congestion on Route 2.,6,46
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time is lower when both players choose Route 1 compared to when they choose Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1.,6,44
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,To minimize total travel time avoid choosing the same route as the opponent. Since the opponent last chose R1 selecting R2 leads to a lower time increase (2 instead of 6).,4,44
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,2,2
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since this is our first round I have no previous data to base my decision on. I will choose Route 1 as a starting point as it is generally the most common route and may have less unexpected issues.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,No previous data to analyze so choosing Route 1 as the default.,6,6
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,6,8
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In the last round we both chose Route 1 and experienced a total travel time of 6 units. Given that there is no information about the opponent's previous move or the travel times for each route I will assume that the travel times for both routes are random. Therefore I will choose Route 2 this round to test if it has a potentially better travel time than Route 1.,4,10
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Since both players previously chose Route 1 resulting in a total travel time of 6 switching to Route 2 may reduce congestion and travel time. Assuming the opponent might stick with Route 1 choosing Route 2 could optimize individual travel time.,4,10
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in longer travel times when both players chose it. However since the opponent chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 2 to avoid potential congestion on Route 1.,4,12
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last round I played Route 2 and my opponent also played Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 10. This time I will choose Route 1 because it might be less congested due to the previous round's traffic on Route 2. I'm assuming my opponent will make a rational decision as well.,2,12
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that both drivers are taking the same route leading to congestion. To minimize travel time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent in the next round. Since the opponent took Route 2 in the last round I will choose Route 1.,6,16
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize my travel time.,2,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Parse Error: int() argument must be a string a bytes-like object or a real number not 'dict' (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel time suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to higher congestion. When both chose R1 the time was 6 then 16 and when both chose R2 it was 10. This indicates that Route 1 becomes more congested over time. To minimize travel time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent to avoid congestion. Since the last round both chose R1 I should choose R2 this time.,4,20
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in shorter travel times when both players chose Route 1 (8 minutes) compared to when one player chose Route 1 and the other chose Route 2 (2 minutes). However when both players chose Route 2 the travel time was longer (12 minutes). Given this pattern I will choose Route 1 to potentially minimize travel time.,6,20
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Parse Error: int() argument must be a string a bytes-like object or a real number not 'dict' (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route the total travel time increases by 6 then 10 then 16 then 20. It seems that the time increases by 4 each time after the first round. If I choose Route 2 and the opponent chooses Route 1 the time is 20. If I choose Route 1 and the opponent chooses Route 2 the time would be similar. To minimize the total travel time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the opponent played R1 in the last round I should choose R2 to minimize the time.,4,24
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 when the opponent chooses Route 2 results in a lower travel time. However if both choose Route 1 the travel time increases significantly. To minimize travel time I should consider the opponent's likely choice based on past behavior. Since the opponent has chosen Route 2 in the last round I will choose Route 1 to take advantage of the lower travel time.,6,26
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and based on the total travel times I would suggest choosing Route 1.,6,26
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that Route 1 has a base time of 4 minutes and Route 2 has a base time of 6 minutes. When both drivers choose the same route the time increases by 2 minutes for each additional round. When different routes are chosen the time increases by 4 minutes for each additional round. Based on this pattern the next choice should be Route 1 to minimize the total travel time.,6,30
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen it seems that Route 1 is more congested. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2.,4,30
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The total travel time for each route is: R1 = 6 10 12 26; R2 = 16 10 20 20. Route 2 has a lower total travel time in the last three instances where I played Route 2. However the last round both players played Route 1 with a total travel time of 26 which is higher than the total travel time for Route 2 in that round. To minimize travel time I will choose the route with the lower total travel time in the last round. Therefore I will play Route 2.,4,30
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,To avoid congestion and minimize travel time switching routes when both previously took the same route is optimal. Since the last round had both choosing Route 1 selecting Route 2 now reduces potential congestion.,4,34
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times when both players chose the same route. However when the opponent chose Route 2 choosing Route 1 led to higher travel times. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 this round assuming the opponent might choose Route 1 to avoid the higher travel time.,4,34

9,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times when both players choose the same route. However when one player chooses Route 1 and the other chooses Route 2 the travel time increases significantly. Given this pattern I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time assuming the opponent might also choose Route 1 to avoid the higher travel time associated with Route 2.,2,36
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Previous total travel time for Route 1 and Route 2 are similar but Route 1 has slightly less travel time. So let's choose Route 1 to minimize travel time.,2,36
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that Route 1 has a base time of 6 minutes and Route 2 has a base time of 10 minutes. However when both drivers choose the same route the travel time increases due to congestion. For example when both choose Route 1 the time increases from 6 to 16 and when both choose Route 2 it increases from 10 to 24. This indicates that the congestion penalty is 10 minutes for Route 1 and 14 minutes for Route 2 when both choose the same route. The optimal strategy would be to alternate routes to minimize total travel time. Given the last round where I played R2 and the opponent played R1 the next optimal choice would be to switch to Route 1 to balance the load and reduce congestion.,6,44
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times when the opponent chose Route 2 and higher travel times when both chose Route 1. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 this round.,4,40
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Parse Error: int() argument must be a string a bytes-like object or a real number not 'dict' (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,40
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that there might be a coordination game at play here where both drivers benefit from choosing the same route. When both choose Route 1 (R1) or both choose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time increases but it seems that the increase is more significant when choosing R2. For example when both choose R1 the total travel time goes from 0 to 6 then to 16 then to 30 and then to 44. When both choose R2 the total travel time goes from 0 to 10 then to 20 then to 24 then to 34 and then to 38. It seems that the increase in travel time is more pronounced when both choose R2 which might indicate that R1 is a more efficient route. However the pattern is not entirely clear and there might be other factors at play such as traffic congestion or road conditions. Given the information available it might be best to choose Route 1 (R1) to minimize the total travel time as it seems to have a more consistent increase in travel time compared to R2.,6,50
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,2,2
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since this is our first round I will randomly select Route 1 as my recommendation.,2,2
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,No previous moves to analyze so I'll choose Route 1 randomly.,6,6
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since last round I played Route 1 (R1) and the opponent played Route 2 (R2) with a total travel time of 2 I will continue to play Route 1. This is because in the previous scenario Route 1 was faster than Route 2 so I will stick with the same route.,6,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Since both players previously chose Route 1 resulting in a total travel time of 6 and without knowledge of the opponent's next move the safest strategy is to maintain consistency and choose Route 1 again to avoid potential congestion from switching routes without certainty of the opponent's action.,2,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in a higher total travel time compared to Route 2 (R2). To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 (R2) this round.,4,8
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Following the principle of 'tit for tat' in game theory I will start by cooperating (choosing Route 1). If the opponent defects (chooses Route 2) I will defect in the next round. If the opponent cooperates I will also cooperate in the next round. The total travel time for the last round was 2 when I chose Route 1 and the opponent chose Route 2.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds when both players chose Route 1 the total travel time was 6 (3 each). When the user chose Route 1 and the opponent chose Route 2 the total time increased to 8 (4 each). This suggests that Route 1 is more efficient when both use it but if one deviates the total time increases. Since the opponent previously switched to Route 2 it may indicate they are avoiding congestion. To minimize potential congestion and align with the opponent's choice the user should choose Route 2 to avoid the higher total time that occurs when routes are split. However if both choose Route 2 the total time remains 8 (4 each) which is worse than 6 when both use Route 1. But without knowing the opponent's strategy the safest choice to avoid the split-time penalty is Route 2.,4,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 has resulted in longer travel times. However since the opponent also chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 1 to avoid potential congestion.,6,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Following the principle of 'tit for tat' and considering the total travel times I would choose Route 1 in this scenario.,6,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds when both players chose Route 1 the total travel time was 6 which is lower than when one chose Route 1 and the other Route 2 (total time 8). When both chose Route 2 the total time was 12 which is significantly higher. This suggests that Route 1 is more efficient when both players choose it but Route 2 becomes less efficient when both choose it. The best strategy would be to choose Route 1 to minimize total travel time especially since the previous round where both chose Route 1 resulted in the lowest time. However if the opponent is likely to switch to Route 2 the total time increases. But given the data Route 1 seems to be the better choice for minimizing time.,6,18
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to longer travel times while choosing different routes results in shorter travel times. To minimize travel time I should choose a different route than the opponent.,4,18
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and based on the total travel times I would choose Route 1. This is because in the last round when both played Route 1 the total travel time was shorter than when playing Route 2 against the opponent's Route 2. Also choosing Route 1 in the first round allows for comparison between the two routes.,2,18
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the route choices are leading to congestion. When both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the time increases significantly (from 6 to 18). This indicates that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to higher congestion. To minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route from the opponent. In the last round both chose R1 resulting in a high time of 18. Therefore the best choice is to switch to Route 2 to avoid congestion.,4,22
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 has resulted in longer travel times compared to Route 1. However in the last round both you and the opponent chose Route 1 which resulted in a longer travel time. This suggests that Route 1 might be more congested when both drivers choose it. To minimize travel time it might be better to choose Route 2 this time as the opponent might choose Route 1 again to avoid congestion.,4,22
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Using the principle of 'Minimax' to minimize my loss or maximize my gain. Since the opponent chose Route 2 in the last round and it resulted in a shorter travel time I will choose Route 2 as well to maximize my gain or minimize my loss. If the opponent chooses Route 1 I will switch to Route 1 in the future to minimize my loss.,4,22
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on the history Route 1 has been used more frequently (6 times) compared to Route 2 (4 times) suggesting potential congestion. Choosing Route 2 may reduce travel time by avoiding higher congestion. The opponent's recent choice of R1 in the last round might indicate a shift but without clear patterns selecting the less-used route (R2) is a strategic move to minimize potential delays.,4,26
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 has resulted in longer travel times compared to Route 1. However since the opponent's choice is unknown it's difficult to predict their strategy. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 1.,2,24
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Previous total travel times for Route 1 are lower than those for Route 2 and the last round was a tie with both playing Route 1. Sticking with Route 1 for its consistently lower times.,6,28
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the routes may be getting more congested. When both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the time increases significantly (e.g. R1-R1: 6 R2-R2: 12 R1-R1: 18 R2-R2: 26). This indicates that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to higher congestion and longer travel times. When players choose different routes (R1-R2 or R2-R1) the time is lower (e.g. R1-R2: 8 R2-R1: 22). Therefore to minimize travel time it's better to choose the opposite route of the opponent. In the last round both played R2 leading to a high time of 26. To avoid this I should choose R1 this round.,6,32
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a shorter travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,2,26

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 6 18 32 etc. which seems to follow a non-linear pattern. When players choose different routes the total travel time is 8 22 26 which is less than when they choose the same route. This suggests that choosing different routes leads to lower travel time. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose a different route than the opponent. Since the opponent last played R1 I should choose R2.,4,36

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Previous total travel times for Route 1 are higher than for Route 2 but last round opponent chose Route 1 when I chose Route 1 indicating they may switch to Route 2 if I switch to Route 2. However total travel time was lower when both chose Route 1 compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to try and encourage the opponent to switch to Route 2 and hopefully reduce total travel time in the long run.,2,32
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 6 12 18 26 32 etc. When players choose different routes the total travel time increases by 8 22 36 etc. It seems that choosing the same route leads to a more predictable and slower increase in travel time while choosing different routes leads to a more erratic and faster increase. Therefore to minimize the total travel time it's better to choose the same route as the opponent. Since the opponent played R1 in the last round I should choose R1 as well.,2,38
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a shorter travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,2,30
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Using the principle of win-stay lose-shift if the total travel time is lower when choosing Route 1 I will stay with Route 1. If the total travel time is higher for Route 1 I will switch to Route 2. If the total travel times are the same for both routes I will randomly choose one.,2,34
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that Route 1 is generally faster when both players choose it but the travel time increases when there's a mismatch. For example when both choose Route 1 the time is 6 18 32 which are relatively lower compared to when there's a mismatch. However when both choose Route 2 the time is 12 26 which is higher. The last round shows that when I chose Route 1 and the opponent chose Route 2 the time was 38 which is the highest so far. This indicates that Route 1 might be better when both choose it but if the opponent chooses Route 2 Route 1 becomes worse. Therefore the optimal strategy might be to choose Route 1 if the opponent is likely to choose Route 1 and Route 2 if the opponent is likely to choose Route 2. However since the opponent's choice is unknown the safest bet might be to choose Route 1 as it has lower times when both choose it but this might not be optimal if the opponent is unpredictable. Alternatively if the opponent is likely to switch Route 2 might be better. Given the last round's high time when I chose Route 1 and the opponent chose Route 2 it might be better to switch to Route 2 to avoid the high time. However without knowing the opponent's strategy it's hard to be certain. The best approach might be to choose Route 2 to avoid the high time when there's a mismatch but this is speculative.,4,42

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,In the absence of prior information about the opponent's strategy choosing Route 1 as the initial move provides a neutral starting point. This allows for potential coordination if the opponent also selects Route 1 minimizing possible congestion. Without historical data a random or default choice is reasonable.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time for Route 1 in the last round was 6 which is less than the total travel time for Route 2 (which has never been played). Therefore I will choose Route 1 again in the hope of achieving a similar or better travel time.,6,12
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The previous round shows that when I chose Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time was 2. Assuming that the travel time is influenced by the number of drivers on each route if both drivers choose the same route the travel time might increase due to congestion. Since the opponent previously chose R2 if I choose R1 again there might be less congestion on R1 leading to a lower travel time. However if the opponent continues to choose R2 the travel time for R2 might decrease. But since the total travel time was 2 when I chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 it's possible that the travel time for R1 is higher than for R2. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 (R2) this round assuming the opponent might also choose R2 again leading to a lower total travel time.,4,6
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in a longer travel time compared to Route 2 (R2).

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In the last round I played Route 1 and my opponent also played Route 1. The total travel time was 6. Since the total travel time increased from the previous round (where it was 0 and no routes were played) it indicates that my opponent and I made the wrong choice last time. To minimize travel time we should choose different routes. Therefore this time I will play Route 2.,4,16
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the route choices are leading to congestion. In the first round with no prior moves choosing either route is neutral. In the second round since the opponent chose R2 and I chose R1 the total time was 2 which might indicate that Route 1 was less congested. In the third round both chose R2 leading to a higher total time of 6 implying that Route 2 is more prone to congestion when both choose it. To minimize travel time I should switch to Route 1 to avoid the congestion on Route 2.,2,8
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 when the opponent chose Route 2 resulted in a lower travel time (2) compared to choosing Route 2 when the opponent chose Route 1 (8). This suggests that Route 1 might be more efficient when the opponent takes Route 2. However since the opponent's choice is unknown in the first round I will choose Route 1 to start with the assumption that it might be more efficient.,2,10
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last round we both played Route 1 and it took 12 minutes. Last time we both played Route 2 it took 16 minutes. Since Route 1 had a shorter travel time in the last round where the strategies were the same I will choose Route 1 again. This is based on the assumption that recent travel times are more indicative of current conditions.,2,18
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both choose the same route the total time is higher (6 when both chose R2). When choosing different routes the time is lower (2 when I chose R1 and opponent R2 8 when I chose R1 and opponent R2 again). This suggests that choosing the opposite route of the opponent minimizes time. Since the opponent last chose R2 I should choose R1 to minimize time.,6,14

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last round I played Route 1 and my opponent played Route 2. The total travel time was 18. I will continue to play Route 1 because the total travel time was not shorter on Route 2.,2,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time increases significantly. For example when both chose R2 the time was 6 and when both chose R1 it was 14. This suggests that congestion occurs when both take the same route. When drivers choose different routes the total time is lower (2 and 8). Therefore to minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In the last round we both chose Route 1 and experienced a total travel time of 6 units. Given that there is no information about the opponent's previous move I will assume a consistent strategy. To minimize travel time it is best to switch routes when the total travel time is higher than the average time for each route. Since we don't know the average time for each route I will compare the last round's travel time with the time it would have taken if we had chosen different routes.  If we had chosen Route 2 last round the total travel time would have been the same as the average time for Route 2 (6 units). However since Route 1 has already been chosen and resulted in a travel time of 6 units it is better to switch to Route 2 to explore the possibility of lower travel times.  Therefore I suggest choosing Route 2 this round.,4,10
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Since both players previously chose Route 1 resulting in a total travel time of 6 there may be congestion on Route 1.

5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Based on the pattern of total travel times when both drivers choose Route 2 the added time is consistently lower (4 units) compared to Route 1 (6 units).

However in the last round both you and the opponent chose Route 1 which resulted in a longer travel time. This suggests that Route 1 might be more congested when both drivers choose it.

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on the history when both players choose the same route the total time increases significantly. For example both choosing R1 led to times of 6 16 and 24 indicating congestion. Choosing different routes (R1 vs R2) resulted in lower total times (10 and 24). However the last round had R2 (me) and R1 (opponent) with total time 24. To avoid congestion and potentially lower the total time switching to Route 1 might balance the load if the opponent continues with R1. But since the opponent's strategy is unknown choosing Route 2 (less used recently) could minimize congestion. However the pattern shows that alternating routes reduces total time. Given the last move was R2 vs R1 choosing R1 now might lead to a lower total if the opponent sticks with R1 but without knowing their next move the safest bet is to choose Route 2 to avoid further congestion on R1.,4,28

10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Based on the pattern of increasing total travel time and the previous choices switching routes to avoid congestion seems optimal. Since the opponent played R2 in the last round choosing R1 may reduce travel time.,2,42
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,2,2
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since this is our first round I have no previous data to base my decision on. I will choose Route 1 as a starting point as it is generally the most common route and may have less unexpected issues.,2,2
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,No previous moves to analyze so I'll choose Route 1 randomly.,6,6
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In the last round I chose Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) resulting in a total travel time of 2. This time I will stick to Route 1 (R1) because even though the total travel time was higher than playing Route 2 it could be due to external factors such as traffic or road conditions that are not consistent across routes. By choosing R1 again I can evaluate if it is consistently slower than R2 or if the last round was an exception.,6,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Switching to Route 2 can reduce congestion and travel time if the opponent remains on Route 1 as both choosing the same route led to higher total travel time (6).,4,10
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in a longer travel time compared to Route 2 (R2). Since the opponent chose R2 in the last two rounds it might be beneficial to switch to R2 to potentially reduce travel time.,4,8
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Based on the total travel time it seems that Route 2 is faster when both players choose it but when you chose Route 1 last round it resulted in a shorter travel time. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to try and minimize the travel time.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the route choices may be leading to congestion. In the first round both players chose unknown routes resulting in 0 time. In the second round both chose Route 1 leading to 6 units of time. In the third round both chose Route 2 leading to 10 units of time. This indicates that both routes might be getting more congested as more players use them. To minimize travel time it might be best to alternate routes or find a less congested path. However since the options are only Route 1 and Route 2 the best strategy might be to choose the route that the opponent did not choose in the previous round to avoid congestion. In the last round the opponent chose Route 2 so choosing Route 1 might be better to avoid the congestion on Route 2.,2,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 has resulted in longer travel times. However since the opponent also chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 1 to avoid potential congestion.,6,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Following the principle of 'tit for tat' and considering the total travel times I would choose Route 1 for the next round as well as it has led to a shorter total travel time in the past. However I am not an AI that can learn from previous interactions so I am making this decision based solely on the given data.,6,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the route choices are leading to congestion. When both players chose Route 1 the time was 6 and when both chose Route 2 it was 10. When we chose different routes (R1 vs R2) the time was 12 which is higher than both choosing the same route. This indicates that the optimal strategy is to coordinate with the opponent to choose the same route. Since the last round had us choosing R1 and the opponent R2 leading to the highest time the best move is to switch to Route 2 to match the opponent's last choice and reduce travel time.,4,16
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to longer travel times while choosing different routes results in shorter travel times. To minimize travel time I should choose a different route than the opponent.,4,18
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and minimizing total travel time I would choose Route 1 (R1). This is because in the scenarios where I played R1 the total travel time was lower compared to playing Route 2 (R2). Also in the last round where the opponent played R2 I will switch back to R1 as per the 'tit for tat' strategy.,6,22
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time is lower (6 and 10) compared to when they choose different routes (12 and 16). This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent minimizes travel time. Since the last round had both choosing R2 with a total time of 16 which is higher than when both chose R1 (6) or R2 (10) previously it indicates that there might be a mistake or change in the pattern. However the consistent lower time when both choose the same route suggests that cooperation (choosing the same route) is better. Given the last round was R2 vs R2 with higher time perhaps switching to R1 might be better but the previous R1 vs R1 had lower time. The reasoning is to choose the same route as the opponent to minimize time so if the opponent is likely to choose R2 again then R2 is the choice.,4,20
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that both routes have been chosen equally by both players leading to similar travel times. To minimize travel time I will choose the route that the opponent did not choose in the last round.,2,20
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning depth 3 and assuming opponent chooses routes randomly if ties. Preferring lower total travel time when previous route choices were the same.,2,24
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds when both players choose the same route (R2) the total travel time increases significantly. To avoid congestion and minimize travel time switching to Route 1 when the opponent is on Route 2 would be optimal. This reduces the likelihood of both being on the same congested route.,6,26
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a lower total travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,2,22
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Using a simple win-stay lose-shift strategy I will switch to Route 2 because last round I played Route 1 and the total travel time was lower when the opponent played Route 2. Also I have seen that Route 1 can lead to longer travel times when both players choose it.,4,28
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The last round both players chose R1 resulting in a high total travel time of 26 likely due to congestion. To avoid further congestion and potentially reduce travel time switching to Route 2 is the optimal choice.,4,30
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a shorter travel time compared to Route 2. However the opponent's choice of Route 2 in the last round suggests that they might be trying to avoid congestion on Route 1. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 1 again assuming that the opponent will continue to choose Route 2 to avoid congestion.,6,28
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Parse Error: int() argument must be a string a bytes-like object or a real number not 'dict' (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,32
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route the total travel time increases by 6 10 12 16 20 26 30. When they choose different routes the time increases by 12 30. It seems that choosing the same route leads to higher congestion and thus higher time. Therefore to minimize travel time it's better to choose a different route than the opponent. Since the opponent last played R1 I should choose R2.,4,34
9,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen it seems that Route 1 has been more frequently chosen by the opponent. To minimize travel time I should consider the opponent's likely choice and choose the less congested route. Since Route 1 has been chosen more often I will choose Route 2 to avoid potential congestion.,4,32
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and assuming the opponent's move is their response to the previous round I will copy their move if they played Route 1 and switch to Route 2 if they played Route 2 last round. The goal is to minimize total travel time and the opponent seems to favor Route 2 in some cases so I will occasionally switch to Route 2 as well.,4,36
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Based on the history when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time is lower compared to when they choose different routes. For example both R1 resulted in 6 both R2 in 10 while mixed choices led to higher times (12 30 34). The last round had a mixed choice (R2 vs R1) with time 34. To minimize time coordinating on the same route is optimal. Since the opponent previously chose R1 in the last round switching to R1 might encourage coordination and reduce time.,6,40
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a longer travel time when the opponent also chose Route 1. However when the opponent chose Route 2 choosing Route 1 resulted in a shorter travel time. Therefore to minimize travel time I will choose Route 1.,6,38
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Following the minimax algorithm the best move would be to minimize the maximum possible total travel time for the next round. In this case we assume that the opponent will also be playing optimally to maximize their travel time. We will choose the route that results in the lowest total travel time in the worst-case scenario.,4,40
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that Route 1 and Route 2 have varying levels of congestion based on the choices made by both drivers. When both drivers choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases more significantly compared to when they choose different routes. For example when both choose R1 (first round) the time is 6 but when both choose R2 (second round) the time jumps to 10. This indicates that Route 2 might be more congested or longer when both choose it. However when the choices differ (e.g. one chooses R1 and the other R2) the total time increases less suggesting that the routes might be more efficient when used by different drivers. The latest round shows both choosing R1 with a total time of 40 which is a significant increase from the previous round where both chose R2 (time 34). This suggests that Route 1 might be becoming more congested or that the pattern of choices is leading to higher congestion on Route 1. Based on this the optimal choice might be to switch to Route 2 to avoid the increasing congestion on Route 1.,4,44
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,6,6
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since there is no information about the past routes taken and the travel times I will choose Route 1 as it is the first option. Moreover I want to start recording the travel times from now on to make better decisions in the future.,2,2
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,No previous moves to analyze so I'll choose Route 1 randomly.,6,6
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Since the opponent chose Route 1 in the last round and the total travel time was 6 it suggests that Route 1 might be congested. To avoid potential delays I will choose Route 2.,4,10
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In the last round I chose Route 1 (R1) and my opponent chose Route 2 (R2) resulting in a total travel time of 2. This time I will choose Route 1 again as it hasn't been proven to be worse than Route 2 in our previous encounters. Moreover I will assume that my opponent will also make the same choice as last time as there is no information suggesting otherwise.,6,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Since both drivers took Route 1 last round and the total travel time was 6 it's likely that Route 1 is congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round to avoid the congestion.,4,10
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that both routes have been chosen by the opponent. Since the total travel time for Route 2 was higher in the last round I will choose Route 1 to minimize travel time.,2,12
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Based on the total travel time it seems that when both routes have congestion (last round you played R1 and opponent played R1 with a total travel time of 8) Route 2 is faster. However when Route 1 is not congested (last round you played None and opponent played Unknown with a total travel time of 0 or last round you played R1 and opponent played R2 with a total travel time of 2) Route 1 is faster. Since we don't have information about the last round or the current congestion I will assume that the conditions are the same as the fastest scenario for Route 1 with a total travel time of 0 or 2. To vary my strategy and not always choose Route 1 I will pick Route 2 this time.,4,12
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds where both players chose Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 10 switching to Route 1 could reduce congestion and lower the total travel time. Assuming the opponent might also switch to Route 1 this leads to a better outcome (total time 6) compared to staying on Route 2 (total time 10).,6,16
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to a shorter travel time. In the last round I chose Route 1 while the opponent chose Route 2 resulting in a longer travel time. To minimize travel time I should choose the same route as the opponent.,4,16
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Using the principle of minimax regret I will choose the route with the lower maximum regret value from the last round. If we both played Route 1 last time and had a total travel time of 8 then the regret value for Route 1 is 0 (since we could not have done better) and the regret value for Route 2 is 12 - 8 = 4. If we both played Route 2 last time and had a total travel time of 12 then the regret value for Route 1 is 12 - 8 = 4 and the regret value for Route 2 is 0 (since we could not have done better). If you played Route 1 and I played Route 2 last time and had a total travel time of 2 then the regret value for Route 1 is 2 - 0 = 2 and the regret value for Route 2 is 0 (since we could not have done better). If you played Route 2 and I played Route 1 last time and had a total travel time of 12 then the regret value for Route 1 is 0 (since we could not have done better) and the regret value for Route 2 is 12 - 8 = 4. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel time suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to higher congestion. When both chose R1 the time was 6 then 16 and when both chose R2 it was 10. This indicates that Route 1 becomes more congested over time. To minimize travel time I should choose the opposite route of the opponent to avoid congestion. Since the last round both chose R1 I should choose R2 this time.,4,20
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a shorter travel time when both players choose the same route while choosing Route 2 results in a longer travel time.

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and based on the total travel times I recommend taking Route 2 this round as it has resulted in a shorter travel time in the past.,4,22
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of route choices alternates between Route 1 and Route 2 with each round. After the last round where both players chose Route 1 (R1) the next logical choice following the established pattern is Route 2 (R2).,4,30
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 when the opponent chooses Route 2 results in a shorter travel time (12 minutes) compared to choosing Route 2 when the opponent chooses Route 1 (16 minutes). This suggests that Route 1 might be more efficient when the opponent takes Route 2. However when both choose the same route the travel time increases significantly (24 minutes for both choosing Route 1). Therefore to minimize travel time it would be beneficial to choose the opposite route of the opponent.,4,28
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The reasoning here is based on a simple principle: if Route 1 was faster last time and the opponent chose Route 2 then choose Route 1; if Route 2 was faster last time or there's a tie then choose the opposite of what the opponent chose last time. This strategy attempts to minimize travel time by learning from past experiences.,2,24
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route the total travel time increases by 6 then 10 then 16 then 20 then 26 then 30. The difference between these increments is 4 6 4 6 4. This suggests that the time increases by 6 when the route is the same as the previous round and by 4 when it alternates. However since the last round was R2 and the pattern alternates between adding 6 and 4 the next increment should be 6. Therefore the next total travel time would be 30 + 6 = 36.

8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times when both players chose the same route. However when one player chose Route 1 and the other chose Route 2 the travel time increased.

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Applying fictional tit-for-tat strategy I will start by choosing the route that you chose last time unless your choice led to a much longer travel time. In this scenario I will choose Route 1 unless last round you chose R2 and it resulted in a total travel time of 12 or less.,2,26
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 4 each time (6 10 16 20 26 30 34). However when players choose different routes (R2 vs R1) the total travel time increases by 4 from the last same-route round (34). This suggests that the travel time is influenced by route congestion and the optimal strategy is to choose the route that minimizes congestion. Since the last round had different routes (R2 vs R1) with a total travel time of 34 the next optimal choice would be to switch routes to avoid congestion. Therefore if I choose Route 1 and the opponent chooses Route 2 the total travel time would be 34 + 4 = 38. However if I choose Route 2 and the opponent chooses Route 1 the total travel time would be 34 + 4 = 38. Therefore the optimal choice is to choose Route 1 or Route 2 as both would result in the same travel time.,2,36

However when players choose different routes (R1 vs R2) the total travel time increases by 2 (from 34 to 36). This suggests that choosing the same route leads to higher congestion and longer travel times while choosing different routes leads to lower congestion and shorter travel times. Therefore to minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent. In the last round the opponent played R2 so the optimal choice is R1.,6,42

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since I don't have any information about the previous choices made by both of us I will choose Route 1 as it is a common fair choice. Also it ensures that we avoid potential bias from the previous unknown route.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,With no prior information on the opponent's strategy and aiming for a balanced approach Route 1 is selected as the default choice to minimize potential congestion and ensure a fair starting point.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose Route 2 last round I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The total travel time for taking Route 1 in the last round was 6 which is the same as the minimum total travel time we have encountered so far. Therefore it is safe to assume that Route 1 is a reliable option with consistent travel times. Moreover there is no information about the opponent's move or travel time in the previous round making it difficult to compare the two routes based on the opponent's performance. Hence I will choose Route 1 again for this round.,2,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The previous round shows that when I chose Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time was 2. Assuming that the travel time is influenced by the number of drivers on each route if both drivers choose the same route the travel time might increase due to congestion. Since the opponent previously chose R2 if I choose R1 again there might be less congestion on R1 leading to a lower travel time. However if the opponent continues to choose R2 the travel time for R2 might decrease. But since the total travel time was 2 when I chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 it's possible that the travel time for R1 is higher than for R2. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 (R2) this round assuming the opponent might also choose R2 again leading to a lower total travel time.,4,6

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and based on the total travel times I recommend taking Route 2 this round. This is because in the last round I played Route 1 and the opponent played Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 8 or 10. By switching to Route 2 we can potentially maintain the same travel time or improve it if the opponent switches to Route 1.,4,14
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time doubles each round. When they choose different routes the total travel time increases by 2. Based on this the next move should be to choose Route 2 to avoid the doubling effect.,4,16
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a shorter travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,6,16
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Based on the total travel time it seems that when both routes are played Route 2 has a higher travel time than Route 1. However when I played Route 1 and the opponent played Route 2 the travel time was lower than when I played Route 2 and the opponent played Route 1. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize travel time. This is a iterative driving decision problem and we can improve our decision based on more data in the future.,6,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,To minimize total travel time choosing Route 1 (R1) when the opponent previously took Route 2 (R2) avoids congestion. If both took R2 in the last round adding 4 to the total time (from 12 to 16) switching to R1 now would likely result in a lower incremental time (2) if the opponent stays on R2 compared to adding 4 again by choosing R2. Thus R1 is the optimal choice to reduce cumulative time.,6,22
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 when the opponent chooses Route 2 results in a lower travel time. However if both choose Route 1 the travel time increases significantly. To minimize travel time I should consider the opponent's likely choice and choose the route that results in the lowest travel time in that scenario.,4,20
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Sticking to Route 1 has resulted in shorter travel times when the opponent also chooses Route 1. However when the opponent chooses Route 2 Route 1 has longer travel times. The total travel time for Route 1 is 6 (when both played Route 1) and 20 (when I played Route 1 and opponent played Route 1). The total travel time for Route 2 is 8 (when I played Route 1 and opponent played Route 2) and 14 (when I played Route 2 and opponent played Route 1). Given the past results it is safer to switch to Route 2 as it has consistently resulted in shorter travel times than Route 1 when the opponent chooses Route 2.,4,24
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of the total travel time suggests that when both drivers choose the same route the time increases by 6 6 6 etc. When they choose different routes the time increases by 2 4 6 etc. This indicates that the time penalty for choosing the same route is higher than for different routes. Therefore to minimize the total travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the opponent played R1 in the last round the best choice is Route 2.,4,26
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the pattern of travel times and the choices made by both parties it seems that choosing Route 2 has led to longer travel times. However since the last two rounds have resulted in the same travel time when both chose Route 2 it might be beneficial to switch to Route 1 to potentially reduce travel time.,2,22
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Sticking to the same route seems to result in longer travel times. Let's try the opposite route of what we and the opponent chose last time. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,28
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of the total travel time suggests that when both drivers choose the same route the time increases by 6 6 6 etc. When they choose different routes the time increases by 2 4 2 etc. The next logical step is to choose Route 1 to avoid the higher increase in time.,6,32
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a lower total travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,2,24
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Sticking to the same route when the opponent chooses differently has led to longer travel times. This time I will choose the opposite route of the opponent's last choice. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,32
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel time increments alternates between +4 (when routes differ) and +6 (when routes are the same). Since the last round had both players choosing R1 (same route +6 increment) the next logical step to minimize the total time is to choose a different route (R2) to trigger a +4 increment assuming the opponent continues with R1.,4,36
9,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in a shorter travel time compared to Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,6,30
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Sticking to the same route leads to longer travel times so let's switch routes to improve our travel time.,4,36
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel time increases by 4 each round when both players choose the same route. When players choose different routes the total travel time increases by 2. Based on this pattern the next total travel time should be 40 if both players choose Route 2 again. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,40
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times and the choices made by both parties it seems that choosing Route 1 has led to longer travel times when both parties choose it while choosing Route 2 has resulted in shorter travel times. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2.,4,34
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Opponent played R2 three times with an average travel time of 28.33 (36/3 - 2) which is significantly higher than the average travel time of 6 when both played R1. Therefore I will play R1 to minimize total travel time.,2,38
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of the total travel time shows that when both players choose the same route the time increases by 4 each time (from 0 to 2 to 6 to 12 to 16 to 22 to 26 to 32 to 36 to 40). When the players choose different routes the time increases by 2 each time (from 2 to 6 to 12 to 16 to 22 to 26 to 32 to 36 to 40). This suggests that the time is calculated as follows: if both players choose the same route the time is 2 + 4 * n where n is the number of times both players have chosen the same route. If the players choose different routes the time is 2 + 2 * m where m is the number of times the players have chosen different routes. In the current round the last round was when both players chose R2 and the time was 36. The next round the players will choose different routes so the time will be 36 + 2 = 38. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,44
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since this is the first round and there is no information about the opponent's previous choices I will choose Route 1 to start with.,6,6
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since there is no information about the past routes taken and total travel time is 0 I will choose Route 1 as it is the first option.,2,2
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,In the absence of specific information about the opponent's strategy or route preferences the optimal approach is to choose a route that minimizes potential congestion. Since both drivers aim to minimize travel time selecting the same route could lead to congestion while different routes might distribute traffic. However without knowing the opponent's choice a default strategy of choosing Route 1 (the first option) is reasonable to establish coordination. This assumes the opponent may also default to Route 1 leading to a balanced outcome.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Since the opponent chose Route 1 in the last round and the total travel time was 6 it suggests that Route 1 might be congested. To avoid potential delays I will choose Route 2.,4,10
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The total travel time was 2 when I chose Route 1 and my opponent chose Route 2. This means that Route 2 was faster than Route 1 in the last round. However since I don't know what my opponent's move was in the previous round I will assume that they could have also chosen Route 1 making the total travel time 1 if I had chosen Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 2 to minimize the travel time.,4,6
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The previous round shows that when I chose Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time was 2. Assuming that the travel time is influenced by the number of drivers on each route if both drivers choose the same route the travel time might increase due to congestion. Since the opponent previously chose R2 if I choose R1 again there might be less congestion on R1 leading to a lower travel time. However if the opponent continues to choose R2 the travel time for R2 might decrease. But since the total travel time was 2 when I chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 it's possible that the travel time for R1 is higher than for R2. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 (R2) this round assuming the opponent might also choose R2 again leading to a lower total travel time.,4,6
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a shorter travel time when both players choose the same route. However when one player chooses Route 1 and the other chooses Route 2 the travel time increases. Therefore to minimize travel time I will choose Route 1.,2,12
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In the last round when I chose Route 1 and my opponent chose Route 2 our total travel time was 2. When I chose Route 2 and my opponent chose Route 1 our total travel time was 6. This suggests that Route 1 is faster than Route 2 when the opponent chooses a different route but slower when the opponent chooses Route 1. Therefore I will choose Route 2 expecting my opponent to choose Route 1 and thus minimizing our total travel time.,4,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the route choices are leading to congestion. In the first round with no prior moves choosing either route is neutral. In the second round since the opponent chose R2 and I chose R1 the total time was 2 which might indicate that Route 1 was less congested. In the third round both chose R2 leading to a higher total time of 6 implying that Route 2 is more prone to congestion when both choose it. To minimize travel time I should switch to Route 1 to avoid the congestion on Route 2.,2,8
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a shorter travel time when both players choose the same route while choosing Route 2 results in a longer travel time when the opponent chooses Route 1. Therefore I will choose Route 1 to minimize the travel time.,2,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and assuming that the opponent's choice in the last round was not a random event but a deliberate strategy I will follow this decision pattern: if the opponent chose Route 1 in the last round then I will choose Route 2; if the opponent chose Route 2 in the last round then I will choose Route 1. This approach encourages the opponent to cooperate and minimizes the total travel time. Also I will switch my choice if the total travel time with my current choice is significantly higher than with the other route.,6,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both choose the same route the total time is higher (6 when both chose R2). When choosing different routes the time is lower (2 when I chose R1 and opponent R2 8 when I chose R1 and opponent R2 again). This suggests that choosing the opposite route of the opponent minimizes time. Since the opponent last chose R2 I should choose R1 to minimize time.,6,14

However when the opponent chose Route 2 choosing Route 1 still resulted in a longer travel time. Given this pattern it might be beneficial to choose Route 2 to avoid the congestion that occurs when both players choose Route 1.,4,18
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' and based on the total travel times I would suggest choosing Route 1 as the opponent seems to choose Route 2 after we choose Route 1 leading to longer travel times. However when both choose Route 1 or Route 2 the travel time is longer with Route 1. But to maintain fairness and avoid longer travel times I suggest Route 1.,6,22
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route the total travel time increases significantly. For example when both chose R2 the time was 6 and when both chose R1 it was 14. This suggests that congestion occurs when both take the same route. When drivers choose different routes the total time is lower (2 and 8). Therefore to minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent.

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Based on the previous rounds the total travel time increases as both drivers choose the same route. When both choose Route 1 or Route 2 the time increases significantly (e.g. 14 18 22). Choosing different routes results in lower travel times (e.g. 2 8).

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern of choices and total travel times suggests that Route 1 and Route 2 have varying congestion levels. When both players choose the same route the total time increases significantly (e.g. R1-R1: 14 R2-R2: 18). When players choose different routes the total time is lower (e.g. R1-R2: 2 R2-R1: 22). This indicates that Route 1 might be less congested when used alone but becomes congested when both use it. Route 2 seems to have more consistent time when used alone but becomes congested when both use it. The last round shows both players chose R2 leading to higher time. To minimize time choosing Route 1 might be better if the opponent is likely to choose Route 2 and vice versa.

This indicates that choosing a different route than the opponent reduces congestion and travel time. The last round shows that the opponent chose R2 and I chose R1 resulting in a total time of 28.

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Choosing Route 1 leads to a lower total travel time compared to both taking Route 2 as seen in previous rounds where different routes resulted in lower combined times. Assuming the opponent may not switch to Route 1 selecting Route 1 minimizes potential congestion.,2,28
9,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a shorter travel time when the opponent chooses Route 2. However if both choose Route 1 the travel time increases significantly. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 this round assuming the opponent might also choose Route 2 to avoid the longer travel time of Route 1.,4,28
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Using the principle of 'tit for tat' with a slight bias for Route 1 due to its lower total travel times in the given scenarios I would suggest taking Route 1 in the current situation as well. This is because in the last round you played R1 and your opponent played R2 resulting in a total travel time of 2. This demonstrates that Route 1 has been more successful in the past so we should try it again.,2,28
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time is lower (6 26) compared to when they choose different routes (10 12 16 20 22 28). This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent minimizes travel time. Since the last round had me playing R1 and the opponent playing R2 (resulting in 28) the optimal choice would be to switch to R2 to match the opponent's route and reduce travel time.,4,32
10,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen it seems that Route 2 has been consistently chosen by both parties leading to longer travel times. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 1 this round.,2,30
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning I have determined that Route 1 is the optimal choice in this scenario. The opponent's previous play of R2 suggests that they may believe Route 2 is faster but our experience has shown that Route 1 is faster when you also played R1 and the total travel time was 2. The only exception is when the total travel time was 16 but the opponent's play of R2 in that scenario also supports the choice of Route 1.,2,30
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route (R1-R1 or R2-R2) the total travel time is lower (6 26) compared to when they choose different routes (R1-R2 or R2-R1) which results in higher travel times (10 12 16 20 22 28 32). This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent minimizes travel time. Since the last round had the opponent choosing R1 and me choosing R2 leading to a higher travel time of 32 the optimal strategy would be to switch to the same route as the opponent (R1) in the next round to reduce travel time. Therefore I should choose Route 1.,2,34
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,7,7

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Since there is no previous round data and the opponent's action is unknown I will choose Route 1 as the default option.,3,3
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given that both players chose Route 1 in the previous round it is likely that Route 1 is currently congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round.,5,12
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time for taking Route 1 when the opponent also took Route 1 is 7. Since there is no information about the travel time for Route 2 I will assume that Route 1 is a consistent choice with this information.,7,14
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Maintaining Route 1 ensures lower travel time when the opponent takes Route 2 as switching to Route 2 would risk congestion if the opponent also chooses Route 2.,3,6
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time when both players choose R1 but a higher travel time when one chooses R1 and the other chooses R2. Since the opponent chose R1 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to R2 to avoid the higher travel time.,5,17
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent chose Route 1 in the last round and changing to Route 2 increased the travel time which suggests that Route 1 is faster than Route 2 during rush hour. Since we don't know the travel time for Route 2 in the first round we can't compare it directly but based on the information given it's reasonable to assume that Route 1 is the better choice.,3,17
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel time is increasing by 3 each round. In the first round it was 0 then 3 then 6. This suggests a pattern where the travel time increases by 3 minutes each time. Following this pattern the next total travel time would be 9. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,11
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time compared to Route 2 (R2). In the last two rounds when I chose R2 the travel time was higher than when I chose R1. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose R1 again.,7,24

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The total travel time increases with each round suggesting that the congestion is getting worse. When both players chose Route 2 in the last round the travel time was 11 which is significantly higher than when Route 1 was chosen. This indicates that Route 2 might be more congested. However since the increase in travel time is consistent it might be due to the overall rush hour conditions rather than the specific route choice. The best strategy would be to alternate routes to avoid congestion but given the last round's result Route 1 might be less congested now. Therefore choosing Route 1 could potentially reduce travel time.,3,14
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times and the opponent's choices it seems that Route 1 is becoming more congested. To minimize travel time I should switch to Route 2.,5,29
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Since the total travel time for Route 1 in the last round was higher than the travel time for Route 2 and the total travel time for Route 1 is increasing while the total travel time for Route 2 remains the same or decreases it is reasonable to switch to Route 2.,5,25
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel time when both players choose R2 (11) is lower than when the user chooses R1 against the opponent's R2 (14). To minimize travel time selecting R2 aligns with the lower observed time in the previous round where both chose R2.,5,19
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time when both players choose R1 while choosing Route 2 (R2) results in a higher travel time when the opponent chooses R1. To minimize travel time I will choose R1 again.,3,32
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In all the given scenarios taking Route 1 results in a shorter travel time compared to taking Route 2. This is based on the total travel time and the routes played by the user and the opponent in rush hour. Therefore the value represents the best route to take which is Route 1 in this case.,3,28
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The opponent has consistently chosen R2 in all rounds except the first. When the user chooses R1 against the opponent's R2 the total travel time increases by 3 (e.g. 3 14). When the user chooses R2 against the opponent's R2 the time increases by 5 (e.g. 11 19). To minimize the total travel time the user should choose R1 as it results in a smaller increment. The pattern of increments alternates between +3 and +5 but since the opponent remains on R2 R1 is the optimal choice.,7,26
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2 (R2). The opponent's choice of R1 in the last round also suggests that R1 might be less congested. Therefore I will choose R1 again to minimize travel time.,3,35
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In all scenarios choosing Route 1 results in a shorter total travel time than choosing Route 2. This is based on the assumption that the total travel time is the primary factor to consider in choosing a route. Additionally since the total travel time for Route 1 is consistently lower than that of Route 2 it can be inferred that Route 1 is less congested during rush hour. Therefore the value returned is the number of scenarios where Route 1 has a shorter total travel time than Route 2 which is in all 6 scenarios. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,33
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 7 11 and 19 which are all prime numbers. When the players choose different routes the total travel time increases by 3 6 and 14 which are all multiples of 3. The next logical step is to choose R1 as it has been the most recent choice and following the pattern of alternating routes to avoid the same route selection which leads to higher travel times. Therefore the next move should be R1.,3,29
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2 (R2). The opponent's choice of R1 in some rounds also led to lower travel times. Therefore continuing to choose R1 might be a better strategy to minimize travel time.,7,42
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The reasoning here is that lower total travel time is preferred as it indicates less time spent in rush hour traffic. Additionally the pattern of total travel times suggests that playing Route 2 more often results in shorter travel times.,5,38
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 7 minutes (e.g. 0 to 3 6 to 11 14 to 19 26 to 29). When the routes differ the increase is 3 minutes (e.g. 3 to 6 11 to 14 19 to 26). The next move should be to choose R1 to avoid the larger increase of 7 minutes assuming the opponent will choose R2 again leading to a 3-minute increase. Thus the next total travel time would be 29 + 3 = 32 minutes. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,34
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,3,3

2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given that the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) and the total travel time was 3 it suggests that Route 2 might be less congested or faster at this moment. However since we are in rush hour it's important to consider the possibility of changing routes to avoid potential congestion. Therefore I will choose Route 1 (R1) to see if it offers a better travel time.,7,10
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time when choosing Route 1 in the last round is 7 minutes which is a better choice compared to the unknown travel time of choosing Route 2. Therefore I will choose Route 1 again.,7,14
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Since both players chose Route 1 last round and the total travel time was 7 it's likely that Route 1 is congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round to avoid the congestion.,5,12
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the current situation in rush hour the opponent's previous choice of R2 suggests they might be trying to avoid the congestion on R1. However since the total travel time for R1 was 10 minutes it indicates that R1 is heavily congested. To minimize travel time I should choose R2 which seems to be less congested based on the opponent's previous choice and the travel time data.,5,15
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The opponent chose Route 1 in the last round and we experienced more traffic (14 minutes) than when both of us chose Route 1 in the previous round (7 minutes). This indicates that the opponent's choice of Route 1 is causing additional congestion. Therefore to minimize travel time I recommend choosing Route 2.,5,19
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize travel time during rush hour. When both players choose Route 1 (R1) the total travel time is 7 which is the lowest so far. If one player chooses R2 while the other chooses R1 the travel time increases to 12 indicating that Route 2 may be more congested or less efficient when only one player takes it. Therefore choosing Route 1 seems to be the better strategy to minimize travel time especially when the opponent also chooses R1. However since the opponent's choice is unknown it's important to consider the possibility of them switching routes. If the opponent sticks with R1 choosing R1 would be optimal. If they switch to R2 the travel time would increase but it's still better to stick with R1 as it has shown lower travel times in previous rounds. Thus the best choice is Route 1.,7,19
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2 (R2). In the last round both players chose R1 resulting in a travel time of 10 which is still lower than the travel time when both chose R2 (15). Therefore it is reasonable to continue choosing R1 to minimize travel time.,7,22
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The reasoning here is to choose the route that results in the shortest travel time. Previous play and total travel time are given as clues to help make this decision.,7,26
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel time increases when both players choose Route 1 suggesting congestion. When one player chooses Route 2 the time decreases indicating less traffic. To minimize time I should choose Route 2 if the opponent is likely to choose Route 1 and Route 1 if the opponent chooses Route 2. However since the opponent's choice is unknown the best strategy is to alternate routes to avoid congestion. Based on the previous rounds the opponent has chosen Route 1 twice so choosing Route 2 might be more optimal to reduce travel time.,5,24
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the current situation it seems that both routes have been congested recently. However since the opponent has chosen Route 2 more often I will choose Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,7,29
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Since the total travel time is increasing while both players are using Route 1 it suggests that traffic is building up on Route 1. To improve the situation I suggest switching to Route 2 as it may have less traffic and result in a shorter travel time.,5,31
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The total travel time increases as more rounds are played indicating that the traffic is getting worse. When both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel time increases significantly. For example when both chose R1 the time went from 0 to 7 to 19 which is a large jump. When both chose R2 the time increased from 12 to 24 which is also a significant increase. This suggests that when both players take the same route congestion occurs leading to longer travel times. Therefore to minimize travel time it's better to choose a different route than the opponent. In the last round the opponent chose R2 so choosing R1 would be the optimal strategy to avoid congestion and reduce travel time.,3,27
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of increasing travel times when both players choose Route 1 it seems that Route 1 is becoming more congested. To minimize travel time I should switch to Route 2.,5,34
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,If the total travel time is lower when choosing route 1 then it is a better choice in the current traffic conditions. Based on the given data when both players chose route 1 the travel time was lower than when both chose route 2. Therefore it is reasonable to choose route 1.,3,34
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The total travel time increases with each round and the pattern suggests that taking the same route as the opponent leads to lower travel times. When both took R1 (7 minutes) or both took R2 (24 minutes) the times were lower compared to when they took different routes (12 19 27 minutes). This indicates that Route 1 is more efficient when both players choose it possibly due to less congestion. Therefore the optimal strategy is to choose Route 1 to minimize travel time.,7,34
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen by the opponent it seems that Route 2 is consistently taking longer. However since the opponent has also chosen Route 2 it might be worth trying Route 1 to see if it can reduce the travel time.,7,41
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,If the total travel time is lower when choosing route 1 then it is a better choice. Based on the given scenarios when the total travel time is lower the value is assigned to route 1 (key 1).,7,41
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players take the same route the time increases (e.g. both R1: 7 19 34; both R2: 24). When routes differ the time is lower (e.g. R1 vs R2: 5 3). The last round had both R1 (time 7). To avoid congestion choosing R2 minimizes risk as it could lead to a lower time (5) if the opponent sticks to R1 or 5 if both take R2. This balances potential outcomes.,5,39
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times and the fact that both routes have been chosen by the opponent it seems that Route 1 is more congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2.,5,46
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,If the total travel time is lower when choosing route 1 then stick with route 1. If the total travel time is lower when choosing route 2 then switch to route 2. If the total travel times are equal then it's a tie and either route can be chosen.,7,48
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Analyzing the pattern of previous moves and travel times when both players choose the same route (e.g. R1 vs R1) the travel time increases more significantly (e.g. +7 +12 +15). Conversely when players choose different routes (e.g. R1 vs R2) the time increases less (e.g. +3 +5). In the last round the user chose R2 while the opponent chose R1 resulting in a +5 increase. To minimize further time increases the optimal strategy is to continue choosing the opposite route of the opponent. Assuming the opponent may stick with R1 selecting R2 again would likely result in a smaller time increase compared to choosing R1. Thus the next move should be R2.,5,44
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,3,3

2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given that the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) and the total travel time was 3 it suggests that Route 2 might be less congested or faster at this moment. However since we are in rush hour it's important to consider the possibility of changing routes to avoid potential congestion. Therefore I will choose Route 1 (R1) to see if it offers a better travel time.,3,6
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The total travel time when both playing Route 1 is 7. This suggests that Route 1 during rush hour has an average travel time of 7 minutes when both players choose it. Since there is no information about the other routes I will assume that Route 1 is the best choice with an average travel time of 7 minutes.,7,14
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Since the opponent previously took Route 2 when I took Route 1 and the total travel time was 3 it suggests that Route 2 might be less congested. However since we are in rush hour both routes could be congested. I should consider switching routes to potentially reduce travel time. If I take Route 2 this time it might be more efficient given the previous result.,5,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a longer travel time compared to Route 2. Since the opponent has consistently chosen Route 2 which has resulted in shorter travel times it would be strategic to switch to Route 2 to potentially reduce travel time.,5,11
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The total travel time for both routes is the same but Route 2 has less variance in travel time making it a more reliable choice in rush hour. Also since the opponent also chose Route 1 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 2 to avoid potential congestion on Route 1.,5,19
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,In the previous round both players chose Route 2 resulting in a high travel time of 8. This suggests congestion on Route 2. To minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to switch to Route 1 which was less congested when used by the user while the opponent took Route 2 (resulting in 3 units of time). Assuming the opponent may continue with Route 2 choosing Route 1 avoids congestion and reduces travel time.,3,11
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time compared to Route 2 (R2). In the last round when I chose R2 and the opponent chose R1 the travel time was 11 which is higher than the previous rounds where I chose R1. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose R1 again.,7,18
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The reasoning here is that we seem to be in a rush hour scenario where the total travel time is affected by the routes chosen by both players. When both players choose Route 1 (R1) the travel time is 7 minutes if repeated and 14 minutes if not. If one player chooses Route 1 and the other chooses Route 2 (R2) the travel time is 19 minutes. Given this information it seems that choosing Route 2 when the opponent chooses Route 1 results in a shorter travel time than choosing Route 1 twice. Therefore the optimal play in this scenario appears to be choosing Route 2 after the opponent chooses Route 1.,5,24
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on previous rounds when the user chooses Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chooses Route 2 (R2) the travel time added is consistently 3 (e.g. from 0 to 3 then 8 to 11). Choosing R1 against R2 yields the lowest incremental time compared to other combinations. Assuming the opponent continues with R2 selecting R1 minimizes the total travel time.

5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in higher travel times when both players choose R1 while choosing Route 2 (R2) has led to lower travel times when the opponent chose R1. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 2 (R2) this round.,5,23
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent's choice of Route 1 when we both played Route 1 or Route 2 in the last round increased the total travel time indicating that they have the same or less traffic than Route 2. Therefore I will stick to Route 1 to try and minimize travel time.,3,27
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 5 each time (from 0 to 3 then 3 to 8 8 to 11 11 to 16). When the routes differ the increase is 3. The next logical step is to choose R1 to break the pattern and minimize the increase.,3,19
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower total travel time when the opponent chooses Route 2 (R2) and vice versa. However when both choose the same route the travel time increases significantly. To minimize travel time I should consider the opponent's likely choice and choose the opposite route.,7,30
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the last scenario where you played Route 1 and the opponent played Route 2 the total travel time was 27 minutes. In all other scenarios the total travel time was less. Therefore it is reasonable to choose Route 1 again to minimize travel time.,3,30
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The user alternates between Route 1 and Route 2 with each round. After playing R1 in the last round the next logical choice is Route 2 to maintain the alternating pattern.,5,24

However if one player chooses R1 and the other chooses R2 the travel time is moderate. Given this pattern I will choose Route 2 (R2) to minimize the travel time.,5,35

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time increases by 5 each time (from 0 to 5 10 15 etc.). However in the given data when both choose R2 the time is 8 16 24 which is an increase of 8 each time. This suggests that the initial assumption might be incorrect. Alternatively the time increases by 8 when both choose R2 and by 3 when one chooses R1 and the other R2. Therefore the next time both choose R2 the time would be 24 + 8 = 32. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,29
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the pattern observed when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel time increases by 7 minutes each round. When the players choose different routes the travel time increases by 5 minutes each round. Since the last round resulted in a travel time of 35 minutes with both players choosing R2 the next logical choice would be to switch to R1 to potentially reduce the travel time.,3,38
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In all the given scenarios Route 1 has a lower total travel time when the opponent played R1 and a higher total travel time when the opponent played R2. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that Route 1 is the faster route during rush hour when the opponent also played R1. However when the opponent played R2 Route 1 has a longer total travel time indicating that Route 2 may be the faster route in those scenarios.,3,38
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R2) the travel time increases by 8 each round (8 16 24). When the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the time increases by 8 each round (3 11 19). The last round had the user on R2 and opponent on R1 with a time of 29. To minimize time choosing R1 (next expected time: 27) is better than R2 (next expected time: 32).,3,32
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,7,7

2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given that both players chose Route 1 in the previous round it is likely that Route 1 is currently congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round.,5,12
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The opponent's previous choice of Route 2 resulted in a shorter travel time compared to the last time they chose Route 1. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the opponent's choice of Route 2 is more efficient during rush hour.,5,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Since both players chose Route 1 last round and the total travel time was 7 it's likely that Route 1 is congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round to avoid the congestion.,5,12

Since the opponent chose R1 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to R2 to avoid the higher travel time.,5,17
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Based on the total travel time for each route we can see that Route 2 is faster when the opponent also chooses Route 2 and slower when the opponent chooses Route 1. This suggests that the opponent has some information about the traffic conditions that we don't have. However since we don't have that information we should choose the route that has the best average performance regardless of what the opponent chooses. Based on the information provided Route 1 has an average travel time of 0 while Route 2 has an average travel time of (3+8)/2 = 5.5. Therefore we should choose Route 1.,3,11
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize travel time during rush hour. When both players choose Route 1 (R1) the total travel time is 7 which is the lowest so far. If one player chooses R2 while the other chooses R1 the travel time increases to 12 indicating that Route 2 may be more congested or less efficient when only one player takes it. Therefore choosing Route 1 seems to be the better strategy to minimize travel time especially when the opponent also chooses R1. However since the opponent's choice is unknown it's important to consider the possibility of them switching routes. If the opponent sticks with R1 choosing R1 would be optimal. If they switch to R2 the travel time would increase but it's still better to stick with R1 as it has shown lower travel time in the previous scenario where both chose R1. Thus the best choice is Route 1.,3,15

However since the opponent also chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 1 to avoid potential congestion on Route 2.,7,24
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent's choice of Route 2 in the last round when the total travel time was 11 suggests that Route 2 is congested. Therefore I recommend choosing Route 1 this round.,3,14
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize travel time during rush hour. When both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel time is lower (7 minutes when both choose R1). If the players choose different routes the travel time increases (12 minutes when I choose R2 and opponent R1 and 15 minutes when I choose R1 and opponent R2). This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to lower travel time. Since the opponent previously chose R1 when I chose R1 and R2 when I chose R2 it seems that the opponent is mirroring my choice. Therefore to minimize travel time I should continue to choose the same route as the opponent which in the last round was R1. However since the opponent's choice is unknown in the first round I should default to R1 as it resulted in the lowest travel time when both chose R1.,3,18

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel time is lower (7 and 12). When they choose different routes the travel time increases (15 18 23). This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to lower travel time possibly due to shared congestion. The opponent's previous move was R1 so choosing R1 might lead to lower travel time. However the last round's travel time for R1 vs R2 was 18 which is higher than when both chose R1 (7) or R2 (12). Therefore the optimal choice is to choose the same route as the opponent which was R1 in the last round.,3,26

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent's choice of Route 2 in rush hour seems to significantly increase the total travel time when you also choose Route 1.

When they choose different routes the travel time increases significantly (12 15 18 23 26 29 minutes). This suggests that Route 1 and Route 2 have similar base travel times but when only one player uses a route it becomes congested increasing travel time. The optimal strategy is to coordinate with the opponent to choose the same route to minimize travel time. Since the opponent has been choosing R2 more frequently I will choose R2 to match their choice and minimize travel time.,5,34

This strategy balances the routes and minimizes the risk of both players taking the same route which would increase travel time.,5,8

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The total travel time for each route can vary due to rush hour traffic but by comparing the total travel times when each route is played we can make an informed decision for the next round. In the first scenario no route was played last round so we cannot make a comparison. In the second scenario both the player and opponent played Route 1 and the total travel time was 7. In the third scenario both the player and opponent again played Route 1 but the total travel time increased to 14. This suggests that Route 1 may be becoming more congested and may not be the best choice for the next round. In the final scenario the player played Route 2 while the opponent played Route 1 and the total travel time was 19. This is less than the total travel time for Route 1 in the previous scenario so Route 2 may be a better choice for the next round. However it is important to consider that rush hour traffic can be unpredictable and the total travel time for each route may vary.,5,24

5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2 (R2). The opponent's choice of R1 in the first round led to a travel time of 7 while their choice of R2 in the second round resulted in a higher travel time of 12. In the third round when I chose R2 the travel time was even higher at 17. However in the fourth round when I chose R1 again the travel time was 20 which is still lower than the travel time when the opponent chose R2. Therefore it appears that R1 is the better choice in this scenario.,7,27
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The reasoning here is that Route 1 seems to have less traffic in rush hour as shown by the lower total travel times when both players chose Route 1. However if the opponent chooses Route 2 and it has been less congested than expected (as in the last two examples) then choosing Route 2 could result in a shorter total travel time.,7,31
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time is higher (8 and 16). When they choose different routes (R1 vs R2 or R2 vs R1) the total travel time is lower (3 and 11). This suggests that choosing the opposite route of the opponent leads to a lower travel time. In the last round the opponent played R2 so choosing R1 would be better. However since the opponent might adjust their strategy it's possible they might switch to R1 in the next round. If I choose R2 again and they also choose R1 the travel time would be lower (11). But if they stick to R2 the travel time would be higher (16). To minimize the travel time it's better to choose R1 assuming the opponent might switch to R1. However if the opponent continues with R2 choosing R1 would result in a lower travel time (11) compared to choosing R2 (16). Therefore the optimal choice is R1.,7,23

Therefore it seems that playing Route 1 when the opponent plays Route 1 increases travel time while playing Route 1 when the opponent plays Route 2 decreases travel time. Hence I would recommend playing Route 2 in this scenario.,5,36
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases more significantly compared to when they choose different routes. For example when both chose R1 the time was 23 which is a big jump from 16 when both chose R2. This suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to congestion increasing travel time. Therefore to minimize travel time the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent. Since the opponent last played R1 the best choice is R2.,5,28
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2 (R2). However the opponent's choice also plays a significant role. In the last few rounds when both chose R1 the travel time was higher than when one chose R1 and the other chose R2. Therefore to minimize travel time I will choose R2 this time assuming the opponent might choose R1 again.,5,35
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The opponent's choice of Route 1 when their previous total travel time is greater than or equal to 19 indicates they are stuck in heavy traffic on Route 1. In this case it is best to switch to Route 2 to avoid the congestion.,5,41
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 7 10 and 15 minutes respectively. When they choose different routes the total travel time increases by 3 8 11 and 16 minutes. It seems that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to a higher increase in travel time suggesting that the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of the opponent to minimize the total travel time. Since the opponent played R1 in the last round the optimal choice would be to play R2.,5,33
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 2 results in a higher total travel time compared to Route 1. However since the opponent also chose Route 2 in the last round it might be beneficial to switch to Route 1 to avoid potential congestion.,3,38
8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In rush hour taking the same route as the opponent (R1 vs R1 or R2 vs R2) tends to increase total travel time possibly due to traffic congestion. The optimal strategy seems to be alternating routes to avoid heavy traffic. However there are exceptions where taking the same route results in shorter travel times such as when the total travel time is 7 or 14.,5,46
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user has alternated between R1 and R2 in previous rounds but the last two moves were R2. To avoid congestion and minimize travel time choosing R1 (the opposite of the opponent's recent R1) might be optimal. However the pattern is unclear so a default choice of R1 is made based on the alternating strategy.,7,40
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,7,7
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Without any information about the travel times for each route or the typical traffic patterns for Route 1 and Route 2 during rush hour it is not possible to provide a recommended route. Once this information is available we can make an informed decision. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,5

2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given that both players chose Route 1 in the last round it is likely that Route 1 is currently congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round.,5,12
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Based on the total travel time of 5 Route 2 is faster than Route 1. Last round you played Route 2 and opponent played Route 1.,5,10
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Since the opponent previously took Route 2 when I took Route 1 and the total travel time was 3 it suggests that Route 2 might be less congested. However since we are in rush hour both routes could be congested. I should consider switching routes to potentially reduce travel time. If I take Route 2 this time it might be more efficient given the previous result.,5,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,In the first round the opponent's action was unknown so I chose not to play. In the second round both players chose Route 1 resulting in a total travel time of 7. In the third round both players chose Route 2 resulting in a total travel time of 12. Based on these observations it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a shorter travel time when both players choose the same route. Therefore I will choose Route 1 in the next round.,3,15
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Route 2 took longer than Route 1 in both cases where they were compared. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that Route 1 is faster during rush hour. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the total travel time is a reliable indicator of the efficiency of each route.,3,13
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The total travel time increases when both players choose the same route. When the opponent chooses R2 choosing R2 leads to higher travel time. Therefore it's better to choose Route 1 to avoid congestion.,7,15
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time when the opponent chooses Route 2 (R2). However if both choose R1 the travel time increases. To minimize travel time I should consider the opponent's likely choice and choose the route that results in the lowest travel time in that scenario.,3,18

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel time increases as both players choose the same route. When both choose R1 or R2 the time is higher compared to when they choose different routes. This suggests that choosing the opposite route of the opponent minimizes travel time. The pattern indicates that the optimal strategy is to choose the route different from the opponent's previous choice. Therefore if the opponent previously chose R1 I should choose R2 and vice versa. The last round had both choosing R1 leading to the highest time of 15 reinforcing the need to switch routes to avoid congestion.,5,20

5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route the travel time increases significantly. For example when both chose R2 the time was 8 and when both chose R1 it was 15. However when the routes differ the time is lower: 3 when I chose R1 and opponent R2 and 20 when I chose R2 and opponent R1. This suggests that Route 1 is more congested when both take it while Route 2 has less congestion when used alone. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 if the opponent is likely to choose Route 1 and Route 1 if the opponent is likely to choose Route 2. The best strategy is to alternate routes based on the opponent's previous choice to avoid congestion. Since the opponent last chose R1 I should choose R2 to minimize time.,5,25
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the history of travel times and the opponent's choices it seems that choosing Route 1 has resulted in lower travel times compared to Route 2. However the opponent's choice of Route 2 in the last two rounds suggests that they might be trying to avoid the congestion on Route 1. To minimize travel time I will choose Route 1 again assuming that the opponent will continue to choose Route 2 to avoid the congestion.,3,26
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Choosing the route with the shortest travel time in the previous round and considering the total travel time for each route I suggest Route 2 as it has had the lowest total travel time so far.,5,24
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The travel time increases when both players choose the same route. In the last round both chose R2 (time 25). To minimize time the user should choose the opposite route (R1) to avoid congestion assuming the opponent continues with R2. This mirrors previous lower times when routes differed (e.g. Round 2: R1 vs R2 time 3; Round 5: R2 vs R1 time 20).,3,28

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Since there is no prior information about the opponent's strategy and this is the first round the optimal approach is to randomly select a route to minimize potential congestion.

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,In the previous round choosing different routes (R1 by me and R2 by the opponent) resulted in a total travel time of 3. To maintain this lower total time it's optimal to continue with different routes. Since the opponent previously chose R2 I should stick with R1 to avoid congestion and keep the total time low.,3,6

This indicates that Route 1 might be less congested when chosen by the opponent and Route 2 might be more congested when chosen by me.

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel time increases by 7 minutes each time. For example R1-R1 went from 15 to 27 (increase of 12) but R2-R2 went from 20 to 32 to 37 (increase of 12 and 5). However the last round had R2-R2 with a total travel time of 37. If we follow the previous pattern of increasing by 7 the next time both choose R2 it would be 37 + 7 = 44. But since the last increase was only 5 it might be a different pattern. Alternatively looking at the sequence of total travel times: 0 3 8 15 20 27 32 37. The differences between consecutive rounds are: +3 +5 +7 +5 +7 +5 +5. It seems like there's an alternating pattern of +5 and +7 but the last two increases were +5. If this pattern continues the next increase would be +7 making the total travel time 37 + 7 = 44. Therefore if both players choose R2 again the total travel time would be 44. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,42
1,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Since this is the first round and the opponent's choice is unknown I will choose Route 1 to start the game.,3,3
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Without any information about the traffic conditions or previous routes taken I suggest trying Route 1 first.,3,3
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Since there is no previous round data and the opponent's action is unknown I will choose Route 1 as the default option.,7,7
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given that the opponent chose Route 2 (R2) and the total travel time was 3 it suggests that Route 2 might be less congested or faster at this moment. However since we are in rush hour it's important to consider the possibility of changing routes to avoid potential congestion. Therefore I will choose Route 1 (R1) to see if it offers a better travel time.,3,6
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The opponent's previous choice of Route 2 resulted in a shorter travel time compared to the unknown result of Route 1. Therefore I will choose Route 2 again to try and minimize travel time.,5,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Since both players chose Route 1 last round and the total travel time was 7 it's likely that Route 1 is congested. To minimize travel time I should choose Route 2 this round to avoid the congestion.,5,12
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Given the pattern of travel times it seems that choosing Route 1 results in a longer travel time compared to Route 2. Since the opponent has consistently chosen Route 2 which has resulted in shorter travel times it is likely that Route 2 is less congested. Therefore to minimize travel time I should choose Route 2.,5,11
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The travel time for Route 2 was higher than Route 1 in the last round where both routes were played. Therefore it is likely that Route 1 is less congested due to fewer cars taking it. So to minimize travel time I suggest choosing Route 1.,7,15
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize travel time during rush hour. When both players choose Route 1 (R1) the total travel time is 7 which is the lowest so far. If one player chooses R2 while the other chooses R1 the travel time increases to 12 indicating that Route 2 may be more congested or less efficient when only one player takes it. Therefore choosing Route 1 seems to be the better strategy to minimize travel time especially when the opponent also chooses R1. However since the opponent's choice is unknown it's important to consider the possibility of them switching routes. If the opponent sticks with R1 then R1 is optimal. If they switch to R2 then the travel time increases but it's still better to stick with R1 to avoid the higher congestion of R2. Thus the best choice is Route 1.,7,19
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time compared to Route 2 (R2).

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on the previous rounds when both players choose Route 1 the travel time increases significantly (from 7 to 19). Choosing Route 2 when the opponent is on Route 1 resulted in a lower travel time (12). To avoid further congestion on Route 1 and minimize total travel time Route 2 is the optimal choice.,5,24
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time compared to Route 2 (R2).

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Choosing the route with the shortest total travel time from the last round. In this case Route 2 has the shortest total travel time of 3 minutes.,5,23
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of added travel time alternates between +7 and +5. When both players choose the same route R1 adds 7 and R2 adds 5. When routes differ time added is 5. To minimize risk choosing R2 ensures a +5 regardless of the opponent's move as seen in previous rounds where R2 resulted in consistent lower increments. Opponent's last move was R2 reinforcing this strategy.,5,29
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the previous rounds it seems that choosing Route 1 (R1) results in a lower travel time compared to Route 2 (R2). The opponent has consistently chosen R2 which has led to higher travel times. To minimize travel time I will continue to choose R1.,3,20
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In rush hour it is beneficial to choose the route that your opponent did not choose in the last round. This is because the opponent's route last round is likely to have higher traffic and delay due to the rush hour. Based on the given data when you choose Route 1 (R1) and your opponent chose Route 2 (R2) the total travel time is the least. Therefore the optimal strategy is to choose the opposite route of your opponent's last round choice.,7,30
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of travel times suggests that when both players choose the same route the time increases more (e.g. 7 when both took R1 5 when both took R2). However in Round 6 the user chose R2 while the opponent chose R1 resulting in a moderate time increase of 5. To avoid potential congestion and minimize further time increases the optimal strategy is to switch routes. Since the last move was R2 switching to R1 balances the routes and may reduce the time increase compared to staying on R2. This aligns with the observed alternation in previous moves.,7,36
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the pattern observed when I choose Route 1 (R1) and the opponent chooses Route 2 (R2) the total travel time increases by 3 minutes each time. This suggests that Route 1 is becoming more congested as more people choose it. To minimize travel time I should switch to Route 2 (R2) to avoid the congestion on Route 1.,5,25

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Analyzing the pattern of previous moves and travel times when both players choose the same route the total travel time is lower compared to when they choose different routes. The opponent's moves have been mostly R1 except for round 5 where they matched R2. To minimize time the optimal strategy is to align with the opponent's likely choice. Given the opponent's recent move was R1 (round 8) choosing R1 again would likely result in a lower travel time.,7,48

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,As a polite and courteous driver I always prioritize taking the highway (R1) to reach my destination as quickly and efficiently as possible. This option typically results in a smoother and faster drive which is why I recommend it.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent took local streets (R2) on their last move which might indicate they are stuck in traffic or prefer slower but more direct routes. By choosing the highway (R1) there is a higher chance of bypassing any potential traffic and reaching the destination faster. The value of this decision is based on the assumption that reaching the destination quickly is the primary goal.,6,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between two routes: the highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario provides two different states. In the first state the user has not made a move yet and the opponent's move is unknown with a travel distance of 0. In the second state the user has chosen R1 and the opponent has chosen R2 with a travel distance of 2. The user is asked to pick between R1 and R2 again. The reasoning involves analyzing the possible outcomes of each choice based on the previous moves and the travel distance. If the user continues with R1 they might be on a more direct route but if the opponent is on R2 there might be potential for conflict or different travel times. The value represents the optimal choice based on the given information.,6,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The last move was R1 and the opponent also chose R1. This suggests that both players are currently on the highway.

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent chose local streets on the last move but choosing the highway (R1) results in a faster travel time so far. Stick with the highway for better overall speed.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is presented with a series of choices between two routes (Highway R1 or Local streets R2) to drive from A to B. The choices are influenced by the last moves of both the user and the opponent as well as the travel distance so far. The pattern suggests that when both the user and opponent choose R1 the travel distance increases significantly (from 2 to 8). This might indicate that R1 is a more efficient route when both parties are using it possibly due to less congestion or a more direct path. However when the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the travel distance is only 2 which might suggest that R2 is a shorter route but could be less efficient if both use it. The reasoning here is that the user should continue with R1 as it has shown a higher increase in travel distance when both are using it implying it might be the optimal route for reaching B efficiently.,2,10
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,The goal is to drive from A to B efficiently. Given the last moves and the travel so far the strategy should be to alternate between R1 and R2 to avoid congestion and optimize travel time.,4,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,I will always pick the highway (R1) as it is faster than local streets (R2). The opponent's moves do not affect my decision. Currently I have traveled 10 units of distance with the last move being R1.,6,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is trying to drive from point A to point B and at each step they have to choose between taking the highway (R1) or local streets (R2). The problem seems to involve some sort of decision-making process where the user's choice and the opponent's choice are tracked along with the distance traveled so far. The user is presented with multiple scenarios each with different combinations of their previous move the opponent's move and the distance covered. The task is to determine the best course of action in each scenario which could be based on factors like minimizing travel time avoiding the opponent or reaching the destination efficiently. The user is given two options at each step: 1 for R1 and 2 for R2. The reasoning would involve analyzing the previous moves the distance covered and the possible outcomes of each choice to determine the optimal path.,2,12

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when the opponent chooses R2 the travel distance increases by 2 each time. If I continue choosing R1 the travel distance will keep increasing by 2. However if I switch to R2 it might reset the pattern or change the increment.

Given the last moves and the travel so far it seems that both the user and the opponent have been alternating between R1 and R2. To optimize the travel time it would be beneficial to stick with the route that has been more efficient in the past. Since the last move was R1 and the travel so far is 24 it suggests that R1 might be the faster route. Therefore continuing with R1 would likely minimize the travel time.,6,30
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario the 'you' represents the current player and 'opponent' represents the other player. The number next to the last move indicates the number of points or distance traveled so far. The goal is to reach B with the highest score. In this case taking the highway (R1) will generally result in a higher score than taking local streets (R2). This is because the highway offers a more direct route and therefore more points. However if the opponent has recently taken the highway (R1) and has a higher score it might be beneficial to take local streets (R2) to avoid direct competition and try to gain an advantage in a different route. But if the opponent has taken local streets (R2) and has a lower score it is generally better to take the highway (R1) to increase the score gap and secure the lead.,2,26

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,When traveling from A to B taking the highway (R1) is faster if the opponent also takes the highway or if the opponent's last move is unknown. This is because the highway usually has a higher speed limit than local streets. However if the opponent takes local streets (R2) and is consistently ahead it might be better to take local streets as well to avoid heavy traffic or delays on the highway. In this scenario the player has been taking the highway (R1) and is currently ahead or even with the opponent so the best choice is to continue taking the highway (R1).,2,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user has alternated between R1 and R2 in previous moves (R1 R2 R1). The opponent's last move was R2 suggesting the user might continue with R1 to avoid the opponent's route. The travel distance increments (6 4 2) show a decreasing trend possibly indicating the user is nearing the destination. Choosing R1 maintains the alternating pattern and may align with minimizing further distance increments.,6,18

To optimize the travel time it might be beneficial to switch to the highway (R1) to potentially reduce the travel time.,2,16
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent took the highway (R1) on the last move resulting in faster progress. Sticking to the highway (R1) is recommended to keep up with the opponent and reach the destination more quickly.,2,18

6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the pattern of the last moves it seems that the opponent prefers to take the local streets (R2) when the player takes the highway (R1). This suggests that the opponent might be trying to avoid the highway possibly due to traffic or other factors. To counter this the player should continue to take the highway (R1) to maintain a faster pace and potentially outmaneuver the opponent.,2,18
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent has been choosing local streets (R2) and making progress even though it's slower than the highway (R1). I will assume the opponent has a good reason for this possibly avoiding traffic or road closures. To catch up and reach B faster I will choose the highway (R1) to make up for the lost time.,6,24
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern seems to be that when both the user and opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel distance increases by 6 units. When they choose different routes the increase is 4 units. Starting from 0 after choosing R1 (6) then R2 (10 +4) then R1 (12 +2?) which doesn't fit. Maybe another pattern. Alternatively looking at the total distance: 0 6 10 12 18 22. The differences between each step are 6 4 2 6 4. It seems like a repeating pattern of +6 +4 +2. If that's the case the next difference would be +6 making the next travel distance 22 + 6 = 28. But the question is about choosing R1 or R2. If the pattern is that after a difference of +2 (from 12 to 18) the next is +4 (from 18 to 22) then the next would be +6 which would require choosing R1 again. But this is speculative.,6,28
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the pattern of the last moves it seems that the opponent prefers to take the local streets (R2) when the player takes the highway (R1). This could be a strategy to avoid the congestion on the highway. However since the player has already traveled 18 units it might be beneficial to switch to the highway to cover more distance quickly.,2,20
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent has been choosing local streets (R2) more frequently when given the chance and currently we are on the highway (R1) with a significant distance traveled.

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern of moves suggests that when both the user and opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel distance increases by 6 18 28 which are not consistent. However when they choose different routes the travel distance increases by 10 and 12 which are closer. The last move was both choosing R1 and the travel so far is 28. If the user chooses R1 again the distance might increase by a similar amount as previous same-route choices but it's uncertain. However since the previous same-route choice after 18 (R1) led to 28 which is an increase of 10 it might be a pattern of adding 10. Therefore choosing R1 might lead to a higher travel distance but since the question is to pick a route the choice might be based on the previous pattern of alternating routes to maximize distance. However the last move was both R1 and the next choice is to pick R1 or R2. If the user picks R2 the opponent's last move was R1 so it's a different route which previously led to an increase of 10 or 12. Given the last increase was 10 (from 18 to 28) the next might be 12 leading to 40. But this is speculative. Alternatively if the user picks R1 again the increase might be 10 again leading to 38. However without a clear pattern it's hard to tell. The safest choice might be R2 to avoid the same route as the opponent but the reasoning is not clear. The value is 1 (R1) as the last move was R1 and the pattern might continue.,2,30

9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of choices seems to be alternating between R1 and R2 but with some consistency in certain scenarios.

To maximize efficiency I should continue on the highway (R1) to maintain speed and cover more distance quickly.,2,10
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent took the local streets on the last move but they have fallen behind in total distance traveled. They may not be aware that the local streets are slower so I will choose the highway again to increase the distance between us.,6,14
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Continuing on the highway (R1) is optimal for faster travel to B as it's more efficient than local streets (R2). The opponent's choice of R2 does not affect the user's optimal path.,6,10

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The player has been consistently choosing the highway (R1) in previous moves even when the opponent chose different routes.

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent has been taking local streets (R2) which is slower than the highway (R1). It's best to continue taking the highway to reach the destination faster.,2,22
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R1 (highway) the travel distance increases by 6 each time (from 10 to 16). If the user continues with R1 the next travel distance would be 16 + 6 = 22. However if the user switches to R2 (local streets) the increase might be different. But based on previous moves sticking with R1 when opponent also chooses R1 seems to follow a consistent pattern. Therefore the next move is R1.,6,22

To optimize the travel time I will choose R2 this time to avoid potential congestion on the highway.,4,24
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The highway (R1) is faster than local streets (R2) with a greater distance traveled.

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R1 the travel distance increases by 6 each time (from 10 to 16 to 22). This suggests that R1 is the highway which has a consistent speed. When the user chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 the travel distance increased by 2 (from 0 to 2 to 4) indicating that R2 is a local street with slower progress. Since the last move was both choosing R1 and the travel so far is 22 the next logical choice would be to continue on R1 to maintain the consistent progress of +6.,2,24

When the opponent chose R2 initially the player still went with R1 and when the opponent switched to R1 the player continued with R1. This suggests a strategy of sticking with the highway regardless of the opponent's moves. The travel distance has been increasing by 2 2 6 6 6 2 units respectively. The pattern of travel distance doesn't show a clear trend but the player's consistent choice of R1 indicates a preference for the highway. The last move had the opponent switching back to R2 but the player is again faced with the choice of R1 or R2. Given the consistent strategy it's likely the player will choose R1 again.,6,30

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose the local streets (R2) when we were tied (travel so far: 22) they might think they can gain an advantage there. However we have been choosing the highway (R1) and are currently ahead. There is no reason to switch to local streets now as we are making better progress on the highway. Also if the opponent thinks we will switch to local streets we can use that to our advantage by staying on the highway. Therefore we should continue to choose the highway (R1).,2,32

When the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the travel distance increases by 4 (from 34 to 40). The next move is to choose R1 as it has been the most consistent choice for the user and leads to the highest increase in travel distance when both choose R1.,2,42

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent chose R2 when we were at position 30 and 32 and changing to R2 at those positions increased the travel distance. Therefore it's likely that continuing on R1 is the better option.

Overall I lean towards R1 but there's some uncertainty.,6,42

When the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the travel distance increases by 4 (from 34). The goal is to reach B which likely requires a specific total distance. Since the last move was user R1 and opponent R2 with travel so far 42 the next move should be R1 to continue the pattern of increasing by 2 when opponent is R2 which would lead to the next increment of 2 making the total 44. However since the previous R1-R2 pattern increased by 2 and the last move was R1-R2 at 42 the next move should be R1 again to continue the pattern.,2,44

12,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent chose the local streets (R2) after my choice of the highway (R1) reducing their total distance traveled. This pattern indicates that they may be stuck in traffic or experiencing slower speeds on the local streets. By continuing on the highway (R1) I can maintain a higher average speed and potentially increase my lead. However if the opponent's slower speed on local streets is due to heavy traffic that may eventually clear up they could catch up if I stay on the highway. To minimize risk I will continue to choose the highway (R1) but monitor the opponent's progress closely in case a significant change occurs.,6,48

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,As a rational and efficient AI I would recommend choosing the highway (R1) for the following reasons: 1. Generally highways have higher speed limits and fewer obstacles which leads to faster travel times. 2. Since the opponent's last move is unknown we cannot predict their behavior on local streets. Choosing the highway reduces the variability caused by other drivers' actions. 3. Since we haven't started the journey yet (travel so far: 0) we can set the optimal route from the beginning ensuring a smooth and time-efficient drive.,6,6

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between two routes: the highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario provides two different states. In the first state the user has not made a move yet and the opponent's move is unknown with a travel distance of 0. In the second state the user has chosen R1 and the opponent has chosen R2 with a travel distance of 2. The user is asked to pick between R1 and R2 again. The reasoning involves analyzing the possible outcomes of each choice based on the previous moves and the travel distance. If the user continues on R1 they might be able to maintain a consistent route but if the opponent is on R2 there might be a conflict or a different outcome. The value represents the optimal choice based on the given information.,2,4
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The last move was R1 and the opponent also chose R1. This suggests that both players are currently on the highway.

2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given that the opponent chose local streets (R2) in the previous move it might be beneficial to switch to the highway (R1) to potentially gain an advantage in speed and efficiency.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent and I have both previously chosen the highway (R1) which is faster but has a higher risk of traffic. Since we have similar strategies and there are no recent updates on the opponent's move I will continue using the highway (R1) to maintain speed and avoid local street congestion. The travel so far is 6 units and the goal is to reach point B from A.,6,12
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between two routes: the highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario provides two different states. In the first state the user has not made a move yet and the opponent's move is unknown with a travel distance of 0. In the second state the user has chosen R1 and the opponent has chosen R2 with a travel distance of 2. The user is asked to pick between R1 and R2 again. The reasoning involves analyzing the possible outcomes of each choice based on the previous moves and the travel distance. If the user continues on R1 they might be able to maintain a consistent route but if the opponent is on R2 there might be a conflict or a different outcome. The value represents the optimal choice based on the given information.,2,4
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The opponent has been consistently choosing local streets (R2) while I have been choosing the highway (R1). This suggests that the opponent may be trying to avoid the highway possibly due to traffic or other factors. To maximize efficiency and potentially outmaneuver the opponent I should continue choosing the highway (R1) to maintain speed and cover more distance.,2,6
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent has been taking the highway (R1) and has made progress in multiples of 6. This suggests that they are following a route with distances measured in kilometers which is typical for highways. To stay competitive and avoid being stuck in local streets I will also choose the highway (R1).,6,18
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between the highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario seems to involve a game or simulation where the user and an opponent are making choices and the travel distance so far is being tracked. The user has previously chosen R1 (highway) in the first two instances and the opponent has chosen R2 (local streets). The travel so far is increasing by 2 each time suggesting that each choice contributes a certain distance to the total. The user is now at a point where they have traveled 4 units so far and must choose again between R1 and R2. The reasoning would involve considering the previous choices the distance covered and possibly the strategy of the opponent. Since the user has been taking the highway and the opponent has been taking local streets it might be a strategic game where the goal is to reach B first or with the least distance. The user might want to continue on the highway to maintain the pace or switch to local streets if there's a reason to do so such as avoiding the opponent or taking a different route. However without more context on the game's rules or objectives the decision is based on the previous pattern and the distance traveled. The value represents the choice made either 1 for R1 or 2 for R2.,2,6
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,The user has consistently chosen the highway (R1) despite the opponent choosing local streets (R2). This suggests a preference for the highway possibly due to its efficiency or familiarity. The travel distance has increased with each move indicating that the user is making progress toward the destination. Given the consistent choice of R1 and the increasing travel distance it is reasonable to continue with the highway.,6,12
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent has been taking the highway (R1) and making good progress. There's no reason to think that they will change their strategy so it is best to stick with the highway as well to make similar progress. Taking local streets (R2) would be slower and may not provide a significant advantage especially if the opponent continues to use the highway.,2,20
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The user has consistently chosen R1 (highway) in previous moves and the travel distance increases by 2 each time. Following this pattern the next move will again be R1 adding 2 to the current travel of 6. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,10
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The opponent has been consistently choosing R2 which suggests they prefer local streets. By choosing R1 I can potentially gain an advantage by taking the highway which is faster and more efficient.,2,14
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent has taken local streets (R2) after initially taking the highway (R1) which suggests they might be trying to avoid traffic or take a shorter route. However we don't have enough information about their previous moves to be certain. To ensure we're not falling behind we'll take the highway (R1) again. If the opponent continues to take local streets and makes up time we can re-evaluate our strategy.,6,26
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Continuing with the highway (R1) to minimize travel distance as previous R1 choices added 2 units each time which is less than R2's 4 units. Assuming the goal is to reach B with the least distance.,6,16
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The opponent has been alternating between R1 and R2 which suggests they might be trying to confuse or outmaneuver me. To counter this I should stick to a consistent strategy. Since I've been on R1 for the last few moves I'll continue with R1 to maintain consistency and avoid being predictable.,2,16
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent has taken the highway (R1) on the last move and our travel so far is not significantly affected by the choice of highway or local streets. However choosing local streets (R2) now would increase the chance of encountering traffic or delays which could slow us down in the future. Therefore it's better to continue on the highway (R1) to reach the destination more quickly.,2,28
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user has consistently chosen R1 (highway) in all previous scenarios regardless of the opponent's moves indicating a preference for R1. Maintaining this strategy aligns with past behavior.,2,18

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since the opponent has been choosing R2 (local streets) when we choose R1 (highway) and making better progress than when they also choose R1 it is likely that choosing R2 will result in faster travel. However if we want to prioritize reaching the destination as quickly as possible we should consider that the total distance traveled so far is already quite high (28). At this point choosing R1 could potentially get us to the destination faster if the highway has significantly less traffic or is much more direct. Therefore the value choice depends on whether we prioritize reaching the destination as quickly as possible (choose 1 for R1) or making faster progress than the opponent (choose 2 for R2).,2,30
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The user has consistently chosen R1 when the opponent selected R2 in previous moves suggesting a strategy to counter the opponent's route. Continuing with R1 maintains this pattern and likely maximizes travel distance based on prior increments. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,22

10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user has consistently chosen R1 (Highway) in previous scenarios even when the opponent selected R2. This suggests a strategy of maintaining the same route despite the opponent's choices. Continuing with R1 aligns with the established pattern.,6,32

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The opponent has been taking local streets (R2) when it makes sense to do so (when the total distance traveled is 20 28 or 30). To catch up I will also take local streets (R2) to try to minimize the distance between us. However if the opponent takes the highway (R1) again I will switch strategies and take the highway as well to avoid getting stuck in local traffic.,4,52
11,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R1 the travel distance increases by 6 (from 26 to 32). When the user chooses R1 and the opponent R2 the travel distance increases by 2. When the user chooses R2 and the opponent R1 the travel distance increases by 4. When both choose R2 the travel distance increases by 4. The last move was both choosing R1 leading to an increase of 6. Following this pattern if the user chooses R1 again the travel distance would increase by 6 making it 38. If the user chooses R2 the increase would be 4 making it 36. Since the user has been predominantly choosing R1 it's likely they will continue with R1 leading to a travel distance of 38. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,36

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between a highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario has two instances. In the first instance there's no prior move and the user must choose between R1 and R2. In the second instance both the user and the opponent previously chose R1 and the travel so far is 6 units. The options remain R1 and R2. The reasoning involves analyzing the possible strategies and outcomes based on the choices made. Since the user and the opponent have both chosen R1 in the second instance it might be beneficial to consider switching to R2 to avoid potential congestion or to optimize travel time. However without additional information on the efficiency or conditions of each route the decision remains strategic. The value represents the choice made with 1 for R1 and 2 for R2.,4,10
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The last move was R1 and the opponent also chose R1. This suggests that both players are currently on the highway. Since the travel so far is 8 it indicates that the highway is the faster route. Continuing on R1 will likely minimize travel time.,2,10
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,When considering the last moves of both the user and the opponent as well as the total distance traveled so far the most efficient choice is to take the highway (R1) when possible. This is because the highway generally allows for faster travel times which is why it has a higher value in this scenario. However if the user and the opponent have both taken local streets (R2) and have already traveled a significant distance it may be more beneficial to continue with that choice rather than switching to the highway and getting caught in potential traffic or slower speeds.,2,12
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user's last move was R2 and the opponent's was also R2. To avoid potential conflict or to alternate routes the user might choose R1 next. This follows a pattern of alternating routes (R1 R2 R1) to minimize overlap with the opponent.,2,12

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,When traveling from A to B the highway (R1) is generally faster than local streets (R2) if it is available. However if the opponent has taken the highway (R1) recently and might cause traffic it may be better to take local streets (R2). In this scenario the last moves were you took the highway (R1) and the opponent took the highway (R1) with a travel distance of 6. In this case staying on the highway (R1) would be the best option due to the opponent's recent move on local streets (R2) and the current travel distance.,2,14
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The goal is to reach B from A with the least travel distance. Based on the previous moves it seems that taking the highway (R1) when the opponent also takes R1 results in a shorter distance (6 units) compared to taking local streets (R2) when both take R2 (10 units). However when the paths differ (you R1 and opponent R2 or vice versa) the distance is 12 units. This suggests that following the same route as the opponent minimizes the distance. In the current scenario the opponent's last move was R2 so choosing R2 would align with their path and potentially minimize the travel distance.,4,16

To optimize the travel time it might be beneficial to switch to the highway (R1) to potentially reduce the travel time.,6,20
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When my last move is R1 (highway) and opponent's last move is also R2 (local streets) it indicates that the opponent is trying to avoid potential traffic or delays on the highway.

Moreover if I switch to local streets now I may get stuck in traffic and lose the advantage gained so far.,6,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel distance increases by 6 or 10 respectively. When they choose different routes the distance increases by 12 or 16. The optimal strategy is to choose the route that maximizes the distance when the opponent's choice is unknown. Since the first move has no prior information choosing R1 (highway) might be better for maximizing distance.,2,18

However the opponent's last move was also R1 which might indicate a potential for congestion or a strategic move by the opponent. To balance efficiency and strategy I will choose the local streets (R2) to avoid potential congestion and explore an alternative route.,4,24
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The highway (R1) is faster than local streets (R2) with a greater travel distance. Currently at 20 units of distance switching to local streets would significantly increase the time to reach the destination. Stick with the highway for faster travel.,2,22

However when players choose different routes the distance increases by 2 (from 6 to 12 12 to 16 16 to 18 18 to 22). The last move was you R2 opponent R1 and the travel so far is 22. Following the pattern if both choose different routes the next increase should be by 2 making the total 24. If the same route is chosen it would be 26.

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,When considering the current state of the route it is important to evaluate the past moves and the distance traveled so far. In most cases staying on the highway (R1) is faster than taking local streets (R2). However if the opponent has been choosing R2 and making progress there might be some reason for it such as traffic or road closures on the highway.  In this scenario when the difference in traveled distance between you and the opponent is small (less than 10) it might be beneficial to consider switching to local streets (R2) to avoid potential slowdowns on the highway (R1). But if the difference is significant (more than 10) it is better to stay on the highway (R1) to maintain the speed advantage.

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since the opponent chose R1 (highway) when you were close to the destination on R1 they might have taken a shortcut.

Since the next prompt shows travel so far as 34 the user must have chosen R1. Therefore the next choice is R2 to continue the pattern of alternating routes.,4,38
12,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,The opponent has consistently chosen R2 which suggests they prefer local streets. To minimize travel time I should choose R1 to avoid the opponent's preferred route.,6,40
12,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since the opponent chose R2 (local streets) when we were near the end of the journey they might have been trying to slow us down. Therefore it's better to choose R1 (highway) to complete the journey faster. Also in most cases choosing R1 is faster than R2.,6,50
12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of choices shows a tendency to alternate between R1 and R2 but with some repetition. The total travel so far is 38 and the last move was R2 with the opponent choosing R1. Based on the previous moves the next choice might be R1 to continue the alternation.,6,44

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When driving from A to B taking the highway (R1) is generally faster than local streets (R2). Since I don't have information on the opponent's last move or the current travel distance I will assume that the opponent has not made a move yet. Therefore I recommend choosing the highway (R1) to get a head start.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Choosing the highway (R1) would likely be faster for traveling from A to B assuming there are no unexpected delays or traffic issues. Local streets (R2) might involve more stops and potential congestion.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given that both you and the opponent have chosen the highway (R1) in the previous move and considering the travel so far is 6 it's likely that the highway is the faster route. Continuing on the highway (R1) would maintain the current speed and efficiency.,2,8
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent and I have both previously chosen the highway (R1) which is faster but has a higher risk. Since we have similar travel speeds on the highway I will continue to choose the highway (R1) to maintain our competitive advantage.,2,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between two routes: the highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario provides two different states. In the first state the user has not made a move yet and the opponent's move is unknown with a travel distance of 0. In the second state the user has chosen R1 and the opponent has chosen R2 with a travel distance of 2. The user is asked to pick between R1 and R2 again. The reasoning involves analyzing the possible outcomes of each choice based on the previous moves and the travel distance. If the user continues on R1 they might be able to maintain a consistent route but if the opponent is on R2 there might be a conflict or a different outcome. The value represents the optimal choice based on the given information.,6,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,The last move was R1 and the opponent chose R2. This suggests that the opponent might be trying to avoid the highway possibly due to traffic or other factors. To maximize efficiency I should continue on the highway (R1) to maintain speed and cover more distance quickly.,6,14
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent picked local streets (R2) when we both picked highway (R1) last. This indicates that they might have found a shortcut or are trying to avoid traffic on the highway. However since I have already traveled 8 units on the highway and the travel distance on local streets is unpredictable I will still choose the highway (R1) to minimize the risk of a longer route.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The user is presented with a series of choices between two routes (Highway R1 or Local streets R2) to drive from A to B. The choices are influenced by the last moves of both the user and the opponent as well as the travel distance so far. The pattern suggests that when both the user and opponent choose R1 the travel distance increases significantly (from 2 to 8) which might indicate that R1 is a more efficient route when both parties are using it. However when the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the travel distance is less (2 units). This could imply that choosing R2 when the opponent is on R1 might be a better strategy to avoid congestion or competition. The last move shows that both the user and opponent have chosen R1 leading to a higher travel distance. Therefore the optimal strategy might be to switch to R2 to potentially reduce travel distance. However without more data on the efficiency of each route under different conditions it's challenging to determine the best choice definitively. The decision might also depend on factors like time of day traffic conditions and personal preference for route type.,4,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,The opponent has been consistently choosing the highway (R1) which suggests they are prioritizing speed over other factors. Since the travel so far is 14 which is relatively high it might be beneficial to switch to local streets (R2) to potentially reduce the overall travel time or distance.,4,18
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent chose local streets (R2) twice and is now 2 time units behind. They might try to catch up by choosing local streets again but this will only increase their delay due to slower speed limits. I suggest continuing on the highway (R1) to reach the destination as quickly as possible.,2,12
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user has previously chosen R2 and the opponent also chose R2. To avoid potential congestion or to alternate routes selecting R1 (highway) might offer a more efficient path. The travel distance increments suggest varying efficiency but without explicit rules alternating routes is a logical strategy.,2,14
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,The goal is to drive from A to B efficiently. Given the last moves and the travel so far the strategy should be to balance between the highway (R1) and local streets (R2) to minimize travel time. Since the opponent's last move was R1 it might be beneficial to switch to R2 to avoid potential congestion on the highway.,4,22
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The opponent has been choosing local streets (R2) and making progress but choosing the highway (R1) now would result in faster travel. However to mimic the opponent's strategy and potentially gain an advantage by confusing them I will also choose local streets (R2).,4,16
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The decision to choose R1 or R2 depends on the previous moves and the goal of reaching B efficiently. If the opponent's last move was R2 it might be better to switch to R1 to avoid congestion or to take a more direct route. However if both have been using R1 it might be better to switch to R2 to avoid potential delays. The choice also depends on the distance covered so far and the remaining distance to B. In the current scenario since the last move was R1 and the opponent's last move was R2 switching to R2 might be more efficient to avoid potential congestion on R1. However if the remaining distance is short sticking with R1 might be better. The decision is based on the previous moves and the need to optimize the route to B.,4,18

However when the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R1 the travel distance increases by 6 (from 0 to 6). This suggests that choosing R1 when the opponent also chooses R1 results in a higher increase in travel distance. Therefore to maximize the travel distance the user should choose R1 when the opponent chooses R1 and R2 when the opponent chooses R1 or R2.,2,44

12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the travel distance increases by 4 (from 38 to 42). When the user chooses R1 and the opponent R2 the travel distance increases by 2 (from 42 to 44).

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When the last moves for both players are unknown it is generally a good strategy to choose the route with the highest expected speed to get ahead. In this case let's assume that the highway (R1) has a higher speed limit and is therefore the preferred route. The opponent's last move not being known also increases the uncertainty making it more beneficial to choose the faster route.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Choosing the highway (R1) would likely be faster for traveling from A to B assuming there are no unexpected delays or traffic issues. Local streets (R2) might involve more stops and potential congestion making the journey longer.,6,6

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The opponent and I have both chosen the highway (R1) in the past resulting in a faster travel speed. There's no reason to switch to local streets (R2) now as it would only increase travel time. Staying on the highway (R1) is the better choice.,2,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user is presented with a decision to drive from point A to point B choosing between a highway (R1) and local streets (R2). The scenario provides two different states: the first where no moves have been made yet and the second where both the user and opponent have previously chosen R1 with a travel distance of 6 units. The task is to determine the optimal choice between R1 and R2 in each scenario. In the first scenario with no prior moves choosing R1 (highway) is likely more efficient for reaching B quickly. In the second scenario where both have chosen R1 and have traveled 6 units continuing on R1 might be the logical choice to maintain consistency and potentially reach B faster. Therefore the value is 1.,6,12

This suggests that the opponent may be trying to avoid the highway possibly due to traffic or other factors. To maximize efficiency and potentially outmaneuver the opponent I should continue choosing the highway (R1) to maintain speed and cover more distance.,2,6
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent picked local streets (R2) last time when we were both on the highway (R1) which indicates they might be trying to slow down our journey. However since we have already traveled a significant distance on the highway it's still more efficient to stay on it. Moreover if we switch to local streets now it might take longer and give the opponent more opportunities to make moves that further slow us down.,6,14
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user has been consistently choosing the highway (R1) in previous moves and the opponent has also chosen R1. Since the travel so far is 12 which is a multiple of 6 it might indicate a pattern or a checkpoint. Continuing with R1 maintains consistency and could be the optimal path based on previous choices.,6,18

This suggests a preference for the highway possibly due to its efficiency or familiarity. The travel distance has increased with each move indicating that the user is making progress toward the destination. Given the consistent choice of R1 and the increasing travel distance it is reasonable to continue with the highway to maintain efficiency and reach the destination faster.,2,8
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Since the traveler has already been on the highway (R1) and has made more progress than local streets (R2) it is better to stay on the highway to reach the destination faster.

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The player has consistently chosen the highway (R1) in all previous moves and the opponent has mirrored this choice each time. Since the travel distance increases by 6 each time (6 12 18) it suggests that each R1 move covers 6 units of distance. To reach B the player needs to continue choosing R1 until the total travel reaches the destination. Assuming the total distance is 24 (as the next logical increment after 18) the player should choose R1 again.,2,20

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The opponent took the local streets (R2) on the last move when we were tied (16-16) so they might have realized that they can save time by taking the highway (R1) now. I will follow their lead and take R2 to catch up hoping that they will stay on R1.,4,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The player has been consistently choosing the highway (R1) in previous moves except for the last one where they chose R1 again but the opponent switched to R2. The travel distance has been increasing by 6 each time when both chose R1 but in the last move the travel distance only increased by 2 which might indicate a change in the opponent's strategy. However since the player has not deviated from R1 yet it's likely they will continue with R1 unless there's a reason to switch. The opponent's switch to R2 might be a tactic to disrupt the pattern but the player might not have a reason to change yet.,2,22

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The player has been consistently choosing the highway (R1) despite the opponent's actions. When the opponent switched to R2 on the fifth move the player still chose R1. This suggests a strong preference for the highway possibly due to its efficiency or speed even when the opponent takes local streets. The player might be trying to minimize travel time or maximize distance covered assuming that R1 is the optimal route regardless of the opponent's choice. There's no indication of adapting to the opponent's strategy implying that the player's primary goal is to complete the journey as quickly as possible rather than outmaneuvering the opponent.,2,24

However when the opponent chooses R2 and the user continues with R1 the increment drops to 2. To optimize progress switching to R2 (matching the opponent's path) likely restores the higher increment of 6 allowing the user to reach the destination faster.

The opponent's moves have been R1 then R2 and now R2 again. The travel distance has been increasing by 6 units each time when both chose R1 but after the opponent switched to R2 the distance increased by 2 units each time. This suggests that R1 is faster when both players are on it but when the opponent is on R2 the player's choice of R1 leads to a slower progress. The player's last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R2 with a travel distance of 28. The next move should be R1 to potentially increase the distance again as both players might be on R2 now and switching to R1 could provide a speed advantage.,6,36

Based on this pattern if the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R1 the next travel distance would be 36 + 6 = 42. If the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the next travel distance would be 36 + 2 = 38. If the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R2 the next travel distance would be 36 + 4 = 40. Since the user has a choice between R1 and R2 and the opponent's choice is unknown the safest choice would be to choose R1 as it has the highest increase in travel distance when both choose R1 which would lead to the highest possible travel distance of 42.,6,42

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The driver started off by choosing Route 2 (R2) while the opponent chose Route 1 (R1).

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The opponent's last move was R1 and my last move was R2. Since it's raining the road conditions are poor which might affect the decision. In such conditions maintaining a consistent speed or adjusting to the opponent's move might be safer. If I choose R1 it could be a response to the opponent's previous move but if I choose R2 it might be to maintain a different strategy.

If this pattern continues the next increment might be +3 leading to a total travel distance of 25 + 3 = 28. However since the last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1 and the previous increment was +5 it's possible that the next increment could be +3 making the total travel distance 28.

The last moves indicate that I have been choosing option 2 (R2) and my opponent has been choosing option 1 (R1). My reasoning is to continue choosing option 2 (R2) because it has been more successful so far. However it is important to note that the travel distance is increasing and the difference in distance between our choices is also increasing. At 36 units of travel I will choose option 2 (R2) again.,5,41
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of moves shows that when the opponent chooses R1 the optimal response is to choose R2 and when the opponent chooses R2 the optimal response is to choose R1. This suggests a strategy of always choosing the opposite of the opponent's last move. The travel distance increases by 5 3 5 7 5 5 5 5 and 5 units respectively. The last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R2. Following the pattern the next move should be R1 to maintain the alternating strategy. The travel distance has been increasing by varying amounts but the last few increments have been consistent at 5 units. Assuming the pattern continues the next increment would likely be 5 units leading to a total travel distance of 45 units. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,45

10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario we are driving from point A to B in the rain and the road is slippery. The goal is to reach point B safely. The last moves indicate that I have been making safer choices (R1) while my opponent has been taking risks (R2). The distances already traveled suggest that taking risks has resulted in some setbacks as the distances do not increase uniformly.  When it's my turn to choose I should stick to the safer option (R1) to avoid setbacks and eventually reach point B safely.  Here's the reasoning behind each scenario: 1. It's raining and I'm about to start driving. I choose the safer route (R1). 2. I've driven 5 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 3. I've driven 10 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 4. I've driven 15 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 5. I've driven 20 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 6. I've driven 25 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 7. I've driven 30 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 8. I've driven 33 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 9. I've driven 36 units of distance and my opponent chose the risky route (R2) last. I should stick to the safer route (R1). 10. I've driven 41 units of distance and we both chose the risky route (R2) last. I should switch to the safer route (R1) to minimize the risk of setbacks.,3,44

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario the goal is to reach the destination (B) with the least total 'travel distance' when it is raining and you are driving. The 'travel distance' is determined by the sum of your moves and your opponent's moves. Since the opponent's moves are unknown we assume they will choose moves randomly so we cannot rely on their moves to minimize our 'travel distance'. However we can minimize our own moves to reduce the overall 'travel distance'. In all cases the optimal move is 'R1' as it is a shorter move than 'R2' which helps to lower the total 'travel distance'.,3,47
11,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of moves suggests a game where players alternate between R1 and R2 possibly trying to predict or counter each other's moves. The travel distance increases each time but the exact relationship between moves and distance isn't clear. The last move was R1 by the user and R2 by the opponent with a total travel of 48. The next move options are R1 or R2 but without more context on the rules or objectives it's hard to determine the optimal choice. Assuming a simple alternating pattern the next move might be R2 but this is speculative.,5,53

12,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In this scenario you and your opponent are in a game while driving from A to B in the rain. The game seems to involve taking turns to pick between two routes R1 and R2. The 'travel so far' distance might represent the progress in the game or in the drive. Given that it's raining and you are driving one might assume that the goal is to choose the route that gets you to B faster or with less rain. However the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact rules or objective of the game. Thus the best strategy would be to optimize for the given information which is the 'travel so far' distance and the last moves of you and your opponent.,5,52
12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of moves shows that when the opponent chooses R1 the optimal response is to choose R2 and when the opponent chooses R2 the optimal response is to choose R1. This suggests a strategy of always choosing the opposite of the opponent's last move. However in the last few moves the opponent has been alternating between R1 and R2 and the user has been responding with R2 when the opponent chooses R1 and R1 when the opponent chooses R2. This pattern has led to a consistent increase in travel distance suggesting that this strategy is effective. Therefore the next move should be R1 as the opponent's last move was R2.,7,60

The game seems to involve taking turns to choose between two routes R1 and R2 and the one who chooses the route with the least amount of rain by the end of the game wins. The 'travel so far' distance indicates the current progress of the trip from A to B.,5,57
13,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern of moves shows that when the opponent and I choose the same move (e.g. R2-R2 or R1-R1) the travel distance increases by 5 8 13 20 40 60 which seems to follow a sequence where the increment increases by 3 5 7 10 20 etc. However when the moves differ (e.g. R1-R2 or R2-R1) the travel distance increases by 5 13 25 30 35 45 48 53 which seems less consistent. The highest travel distance so far is 60 and the last move was R1-R1. If I choose R1 again it might continue the pattern of same moves increasing the distance. But since the increments are not strictly following a clear mathematical pattern it's hard to predict exactly. However based on the last move being R1-R1 and the previous same move increment of 20 (from 40 to 60) if I choose R1 again it might increase by a similar or larger amount. But since the last move was R1-R1 and the next choice is between R1 and R2 choosing R1 might be the logical choice to continue the same move pattern.,3,63

The goal is to minimize the impact of the rain on your driving which is measured by the 'travel so far' value. Since it's raining we assume that both routes have equal probability of being affected by the rain. Therefore to minimize the impact of the rain we should choose the route that was chosen less frequently in the past few moves. This strategy is called 'win-stay lose-shift' - we stay on the same route if it was a good choice (didn't result in a higher 'travel so far' value) and shift to the other route if it was a bad choice (resulted in a higher 'travel so far' value).,3,65

The options available are to pick either R1 or R2. Given the lack of specific information about the opponent's strategy or the exact conditions of the road the decision between R1 and R2 would depend on factors like road conditions visibility and safety. However without additional context a random choice between the two options is reasonable. Therefore the value is chosen randomly as 1.,7,7

This suggests that R1 provides a more significant increase in travel distance when both parties choose it while R2 provides a smaller but consistent increase when both choose R2. Given the current state where both the user and opponent have chosen R2 and the travel distance is 32 the next logical step would be to continue with R2 to maintain the consistent increase of 5 units.

The last moves refer to the previous choices made by you and your opponent. The 'travel so far' value represents the total distance traveled so far on the current route. Based on the given scenarios the best choice is to pick R1 when it leads to a lower total distance and R2 otherwise. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,72
14,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The opponent has consistently chosen R2 in the last moves and maintaining R2 has led to steady progress (increasing travel by 5 each time). There is no indication of a need to switch strategies so continuing with R2 aligns with the observed pattern and stability.,5,72

15,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In this scenario you are driving from point A to B in the rain and have to choose between two routes R1 and R2. The 'travel so far' distance indicates the total distance you have covered including any detours or repeats. The 'last moves' indicate your previous choices and your opponent's choices. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled. In general if your opponent chooses a route it is beneficial to choose the other route to avoid unnecessary detours. However if you are far enough ahead it may be beneficial to choose the same route as your opponent to increase the likelihood that they will continue to choose that route allowing you to make progress while they repeat the same detour.,5,77
15,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the travel distance increases by 5 each time. However when the opponent switches to R1 the travel distance increases by 5 as well but the user's choice of R2 continues. The consistent choice of R2 by the user despite the opponent's occasional R1 suggests that R2 is the optimal strategy for maximizing travel distance. Therefore the next move should be R2.,5,77

The last move was unknown and I have not traveled any distance yet. I need to choose between two routes R1 and R2. Since the weather is bad I should consider the safety and reliability of the routes. Without additional information I will assume both routes are equally safe and reliable. Therefore I will choose the first route R1 as it is the default option.,7,7

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a decision point with two options (R1 or R2) under rainy conditions. Since no specific details about the routes or opponent's strategy are provided the choice is arbitrary. Picking R1 as the first option is a logical default.,7,7
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the current situation where it's raining and both you and your opponent have chosen R1 it's important to consider the potential impact of rain on road conditions. Since you've already traveled 7 units continuing with R1 might be a safe choice as it maintains consistency in your route. However if R2 offers a more direct or less risky path under rainy conditions it could be worth considering.,7,14
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,It's still raining and I'm driving from A to B. My last move was R1 and the opponent's last move was R2 which indicates they are trying to overtake me. To maintain my lead I will continue with R1.,7,10
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Choosing R2 avoids potential risks from the rain which may make R1 less safe or efficient. Since both parties previously took R1 switching to R2 could prevent conflicts or delays caused by adverse weather conditions.,5,12
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the consistent choice of R1 by both parties and the current travel distance it seems that R1 is the preferred route under these conditions.,3,17
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this scenario the best decision depends on the last moves of the opponent. If the opponent chose R2 after your R1 then it is beneficial to pick R2 as well to minimize the loss. If the opponent chose R1 then it is better to pick R1 again to avoid a standstill. However since the last moves were R1 from you and R1 from the opponent it is best to switch to R2 to try to gain an advantage. The value of 2 is chosen because it represents picking R2.,5,15
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user should choose R1 to maximize travel distance as previous R1 choices added more distance (7 units) compared to R2 (5 units).,7,19

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this scenario the goal is to minimize travel distance while driving from A to B in rainy conditions. The last moves of the opponent are considered when making a decision. If the opponent chose R2 in the last move and you chose R1 it would be reasonable to continue with R1 to avoid the puddle you just went through. However if you both chose the same option changing to the other option might be beneficial to avoid the puddle you both just went through. The distances traveled so far also indicate that R1 has a shorter distance for the first puddle while R2 has a shorter distance for the second puddle.,7,22

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this scenario the goal is to minimize the distance traveled while driving from A to B in the rain where making a right turn (R1) is shorter than making a left turn (R2). The last moves indicate the player's previous turn and the opponent's last turn. Based on this information we can determine the best move to make next. 1. If the last moves were 'you None opponent Unknown' it means you haven't made a move yet and the opponent made a right turn. In this case you should also make a right turn to minimize the distance. 2. If the last moves were 'you R1 opponent R2' it means you made a right turn and the opponent made a left turn. In this case you should also make a right turn to continue minimizing the distance. 3. If the last moves were 'you R1 opponent R1' it means you and the opponent both made right turns. In this case you should switch to making a left turn to avoid the oncoming traffic from the right. 4. If the last moves were 'you R2 opponent R2' it means you and the opponent both made left turns. In this case you should switch to making a right turn to minimize the distance. 5. If the last moves were 'you R1 opponent R1' and you have already traveled 22 units of distance it means you and the opponent have been alternating between right and left turns for a while. In this case you should switch to making a left turn to avoid the oncoming traffic from the right.,7,29
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of moves shows that when both the user and opponent choose the same move (R1 or R2) the travel distance increases by 7 12 and 19. However when the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the travel distance increases by 24. The difference between the last two steps (24 - 19) is 5 which suggests that the next move might be R1 as it's the move that was previously used when the opponent chose R1. This is a simple pattern recognition approach assuming that the opponent's move will continue to be R1 and the user should choose R1 to maintain the pattern.,7,31

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this scenario the goal is to minimize the 'travel so far' value which represents the total number of rounds taken to get from A to B while driving in the rain. The optimal route-planning strategy would be to always choose the road that has been taken less frequently in order to evenly distribute the wear on both roads. This is also known as the 'minimax' strategy. Based on the last moves of the opponent and the driver and the current 'travel so far' value we can determine the optimal move.,7,36
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel so far shows that each time the player chooses R1 or R2 the travel distance increases by 7 then 5 then 7 then 5 then 7. The pattern alternates between adding 7 and 5. Following this pattern the next increment should be 5. The last travel distance was 31 so adding 5 gives 36.

The last moves of the user and the opponent are given along with the distance traveled so far. The user is asked to choose between two options (R1 or R2) each time. Since it's raining the best option to minimize the impact of the rain on the car is to choose R1 (which could be a rain-resistant option such as a windshield wiper or a rain-resistant window) as it would help to improve visibility while driving. The opponent's moves do not affect the user's decision as the user can only control their own actions. The value represents the distance traveled so far which increases as the user makes more moves.

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In this scenario the goal is to reach point B while driving in the rain and making decisions based on previous moves. Since it's raining using the windshield wipers is necessary and the choice is between using the 'R1' (intermittent) or 'R2' (continuous) setting. The higher the number of repetitions of the same move the more reasonable it becomes to continue with that move. This is because the other driver has already shown a pattern and sticking to a counter-pattern can lead to suboptimal outcomes. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,46

The 'last moves' indicate the previous choices made by the player (you) and the opponent. The 'travel so far' indicates the total distance traveled on both routes combined. The optimal strategy here is to choose the route that has been taken less frequently as this will result in less congestion and faster travel. This is known as the 'less-used' or 'explore-then-exploit' strategy.,5,51
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel increments shows a sequence of +7 +5 +7 +5 +7 +5 +5 +5.

This indicates a strategy of consistency with the opponent's previous move but with a slight preference for R1.,7,56
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario the goal is to get from point A to B while it's raining and driving. The last moves indicate that you have been choosing 'R1' and your opponent has been choosing 'R2' or 'R1'. The 'travel so far' values suggest that choosing 'R1' results in less distance traveled than choosing 'R2'. Therefore it is reasonable to continue choosing 'R1' to minimize the distance traveled in this scenario.,3,54
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of moves shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the travel distance increases by 5 (from 0 to 5 10 to 15 etc.) but in the given data the increments are inconsistent. However the last move where both chose R2 resulted in a travel so far of 46 and the next move where the user chose R2 and the opponent chose R1 resulted in 51. This suggests that choosing R2 when the opponent chooses R1 adds 5 to the travel distance. Therefore the next logical move would be to choose R2 again to continue the pattern of adding 5.,5,56

However in the given data the travel so far increments are inconsistent with this pattern. The last move was R2 by both and the travel so far is 61. If the pattern continues the next move should be R2 again adding 5 to reach 66. But since the options are R1 or R2 and the last move was R2 the next logical choice might be R1 to break the pattern and see a different increment.

This decision is based on the assumption that starting with R1 might offer a safer or more strategic advantage in the given conditions especially considering the rain might affect driving conditions and visibility.

If the player has chosen R1 in the previous move and the opponent has also chosen R1 the player should continue on R1 as they are already familiar with the route and it is safer to stick to it.

This suggests that when both players choose the same route they might be encountering some congestion or delay but when they choose different routes they might be avoiding congestion and moving more efficiently. Therefore the optimal strategy would be to choose the route that the opponent is not choosing. In the last move the opponent chose R2 so the optimal choice would be R1.,3,30

The reasoning behind the value returned is based on the assumption that we want to minimize the total distance traveled.  1.

However as the travel distance increases the condition of Route 1 may deteriorate due to the rain making Route 2 a more reliable option.

This could indicate that the opponent believes R1 is a better choice in these conditions.

The travel distance increases by 7 units each time indicating a possible route or path that is being followed. The decision to choose R1 or R2 may depend on factors such as the road conditions due to the rain the opponent's actions and the progress made so far.

By making the same turn as the opponent we can increase the likelihood of them making a longer left turn allowing us to make more right turns and thus cover less distance.

The user's last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R2 with a travel so far of 49. The next move options are R1 or R2 and the user is expected to choose one. The reasoning is based on the pattern of moves and the distance covered suggesting that the user might be trying to reach point B by choosing the most efficient route based on the distance covered in previous moves. However without more information on the exact rules of the game or the distance of each route it's difficult to determine the optimal move.

The strategy is as follows: if the last move of the opponent was the same as yours switch to the other action; otherwise stay with the same action. This is because if your opponent has made the same move as you in the last round it indicates that they expect rain and switching to the other action may allow you to avoid the rain. Let's apply this strategy to each scenario provided: 1. Last moves: you None opponent Unknown. Travel so far: 0. Since the opponent's last move is unknown we'll assume they took the same action as you (which is none). Therefore switch to the other action: R1. 2. Last moves: you R1 opponent R2. Travel so far: 3. Since the opponent's last move was different from yours stay with the same action: R1. 3. Last moves: you R1 opponent R2. Travel so far: 6.

The user has been consistently choosing R2 which has resulted in higher travel distances (e.g. 15 20 25 30 35). However in the most recent move the opponent switched to R1 which might indicate a change in strategy. The user's previous choice of R2 has been effective in increasing the travel distance but the opponent's switch to R1 might suggest a need to adapt. The decision to choose R1 or R2 would depend on whether the user wants to maintain the current strategy or respond to the opponent's change. Given the consistent progress with R2 it might be optimal to continue with R2 unless there's a reason to believe that R1 would be more effective in the current context.

The user's goal is likely to reach point B as efficiently as possible considering the rain might affect the speed or safety of the journey. The choice between R1 and R2 could be based on factors like speed safety or avoiding obstacles. The user's previous choices of R2 have resulted in higher travel distances suggesting that R2 might be the more effective move in this context. However the opponent's moves might influence the user's decision as the user might need to adjust their strategy based on the opponent's actions.

Since the opponent's last move was R2 and the user has been consistently choosing R2 it might be beneficial to continue with R2 to maintain the momentum and achieve the goal of reaching point B efficiently. However the user should also consider the potential risks of continuing with R2 such as possible obstacles or changes in the road conditions due to the rain. The user might need to balance between maintaining the current strategy and adapting to new information or changes in the environment. In this case since the opponent has also chosen R2 it might be a good idea to continue with R2 to maintain the same pace and avoid any potential conflicts or delays that might arise from changing strategies.

The key observation is that when both the user and the opponent choose R2 the travel distance increases by 5 units each time. This suggests that R2 might be the more effective choice in this context possibly due to the rain conditions which might make R1 less efficient. The reasoning is based on the consistent increase in travel distance when R2 is chosen indicating that it might be the optimal strategy in this scenario.,5,55

The road is divided into 1-meter sections and your task is to choose whether to drive on the right (R1) or left (R2) side of the road. The last moves of both players are given as well as the total distance traveled so far. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled. My strategy is to always pick the side that was chosen least frequently by the opponent in the previous 10 meters as this will reduce the chance of following the same path as the opponent and thus increase the total distance traveled. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,70
14,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The user has consistently chosen R2 when the opponent also chose R2 leading to steady progress (increasing travel by 5 units each time). Since the current state matches this pattern (both R2 travel 65) continuing with R2 maintains the established strategy.,5,70

15,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario you and your opponent are driving from point A to point B in a rainstorm. The road is slippery so each move you make (R1 or R2) results in a certain distance traveled but also increases the risk of an accident. The goal is to reach point B safely while minimizing travel time. In this set of scenarios I will assume that the 'R' values represent different speeds or driving styles with R1 being the safer but slower option and R2 being the riskier but faster option. The 'Travel so far' value represents the total distance covered so far in the journey. When deciding which option to choose I will consider the following factors: 1. The last moves of both you and your opponent. 2. The total distance traveled so far. 3. The relative safety and efficiency of each option. In general if the total distance traveled is not a multiple of 7 I will choose the safer option (R1) to avoid increasing the risk of an accident. If the total distance traveled is a multiple of 7 I will choose the riskier option (R2) to try and minimize travel time. There are some exceptions to this rule such as when the last move of your opponent was R2 in which case I may choose R1 to reduce the risk of an accident. Based on this reasoning here are my choices for each scenario:,3,73
15,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a situation where the driver is moving from point A to point B while it's raining. The driver has to choose between two routes R1 and R2 with each choice affecting the travel distance. The pattern of choices and the distances traveled suggests that the driver is trying to reach point B with the least possible travel distance. The last moves indicate that the driver has been consistently choosing R2 which has resulted in a higher travel distance compared to R1. However the driver has also faced situations where the opponent has chosen R1 which might have affected the travel distance. The driver's goal is to reach point B with the least possible travel distance and the choices made so far have been based on the opponent's moves and the travel distance. The driver's next move should be to choose R1 to minimize the travel distance and reach point B as quickly as possible.,7,77

The last move was unknown and I have not traveled any distance yet. I need to choose between two routes R1 and R2. Since the weather is bad I should consider the safety and reliability of the routes. Without additional information I will assume both routes are equally safe and reliable. Therefore I will choose the first route R1 as it is the default option.,3,3
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since it's raining I recommend taking a road that is well-maintained and less prone to flooding or slippery conditions. Given that I don't have information about the last move and the current travel distance is 0 I suggest starting with Route 1 (R1). Route 1 is typically better maintained and may have fewer hazards in rainy conditions.,7,7
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The situation describes a scenario where it's raining and the user is driving from point A to point B. The last moves indicate that the user has not made any move (you None) and the opponent's move is unknown. The travel distance so far is 0 meaning the journey has just started. The options provided are to pick either R1 or R2. Given the lack of specific information about the opponent's strategy the environment (raining) and the fact that the journey has just begun the best approach is to choose R1 as the initial move. This decision is based on the assumption that starting with R1 might offer a safer or more strategic advantage in the given conditions especially considering the rain might affect driving conditions and visibility. Without further details R1 is a logical first choice to initiate progress towards the destination.,3,3

Since we are driving from A to B and considering the travel distance so far is 3 I need to make a decision on whether to continue with R1 or switch to R2. The choice might depend on factors like road conditions traffic and personal preference for handling rain. However without specific information about these factors I will assume that sticking with the previous choice (R1) could provide consistency and familiarity in navigating through the rain.,7,10
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,It's still raining and I'm already driving from A to B with 7 miles traveled. Since my last move was R1 and my opponent also chose R1 I will continue with R1 to maintain consistency and avoid confusion.,3,10

3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario describes a situation where two entities are driving from point A to point B in the rain with each making a series of moves (R1 or R2) that affect their progress. The goal is to determine the optimal next move (R1 or R2) based on the given history of moves and the current travel distance. The reasoning involves analyzing the pattern of moves and their impact on the progress made so far to predict the best course of action for the next step.,5,15

This suggests a pattern of mutual agreement or coordination. Given that it's raining and the travel distance is increasing it's likely that both parties are trying to maintain a steady pace. Therefore continuing with R1 seems to be the most consistent and logical choice.,7,24
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In all scenarios staying on the same route (R1) is the safer option as the weather conditions are not ideal for switching routes or trying unfamiliar paths.

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a situation where two entities are driving from point A to point B in the rain with each making a series of moves (R1 or R2) that affect their progress. The goal is to determine the optimal next move (R1 or R2) based on the previous moves and the distance traveled so far. The pattern of moves and the distance traveled suggests that the entities are trying to reach point B efficiently possibly in a competitive or cooperative manner. The last move by the user was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1 with a total travel distance of 15. The next move should be chosen based on the previous moves and the distance traveled with the aim of reaching point B as efficiently as possible. The optimal move would be to continue with R1 as it has been the most effective in the previous moves leading to a greater distance traveled.,7,22

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this scenario the goal is to get from point A to point B while it is raining and making the minimum number of stops. The 'last moves' input indicates the previous decisions made by the player (you) and the opponent and the 'travel so far' input indicates how far the player has traveled. The options to pick from are R1 and R2 which could represent different routes or actions. Based on the current state and assuming that the opponent's move is unknown or unpredictable the best option is to minimize the chance of having to backtrack. Therefore the reasoning behind the following value is as follows:,5,23
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The opponent has mirrored previous moves (R1 after R1) suggesting a pattern. To break potential predictability and maximize travel distance choosing R2 introduces variability. Previous travel increments (e.g. +7) suggest R2 might contribute more progress.,5,27

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In all scenarios the optimal choice is R2 as it consistently results in greater distance traveled compared to R1.

The 'last moves' indicate the previous decisions made by the player (you) and the opponent. The 'travel so far' indicates the distance covered. The options are to pick Route 1 (R1) or Route 2 (R2). Since it's raining it is reasonable to assume that one route may be slower due to flooding or poor road conditions. To minimize the risk of being stuck in traffic it is beneficial to choose the opposite route of the opponent as they might have information about the current situation of their chosen route. Therefore the reasoning here is to pick the opposite route of the opponent to avoid potential delays due to heavy rain.,3,31

The pattern of moves suggests that the user has been alternating between R1 and R2 but the opponent's moves are less predictable. The travel distance has been increasing but not consistently.

The driver has to choose between R1 and R2 for the next move. The pattern of the last moves suggests that both the driver and the opponent have been choosing R1 which might indicate a consistent strategy or a response to the current conditions (rain). The travel distance so far is 14 which is a multiple of 7 and the previous steps were at 0 and 7. This might suggest that the journey is divided into segments of 7 units each and the driver is on the second segment. The choice between R1 and R2 could be based on maintaining consistency with previous moves adapting to the opponent's strategy or adjusting for the rain. However without additional context on what R1 and R2 represent (e.g. routes speeds actions) it's challenging to determine the optimal choice. Assuming that R1 has been effective so far and the opponent is also using R1 continuing with R1 might be a logical choice to maintain the current strategy. Alternatively if there's a need to vary the approach to avoid predictability or to optimize for the rain conditions R2 might be considered.

This suggests that R1 is more effective for progress when both choose it but if the opponent chooses R2 the progress is slower.

So if the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the travel distance increases by 3.

The last move was R2 by the user and R1 by the opponent resulting in a 5-unit increase. Given the previous pattern choosing R1 again might lead to a larger increase if the opponent continues with R1 but since the opponent's last move was R1 it's logical to assume they might continue with R1.

However when there's a mismatch (user R1 opponent R2 or user R2 opponent R1) the increase is smaller (from 14 to 17 17 to 27 27 to 32). This suggests that matching moves lead to greater progress. The last move was user R1 opponent R1 with travel so far at 39. Following the pattern the next match would likely be a 12-point increase (since the increments were 7 7 10 7 10 5 7). The most recent increase was 7 (from 32 to 39) so the next might be 12 leading to 39 + 12 = 51. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,44

The travel so far values indicate that R1 has been chosen in the past and the goal is to reach the destination in the shortest possible way.,7,47

However when there's a mix of R1 and R2 the increments are smaller (e.g. 14 to 17 (+3) 27 to 32 (+5) 44 is after R2/R2). The last move was R2/R2 and the next choice is between R1 and R2. If the pattern continues choosing R2 might lead to a smaller increment but the inconsistencies in the pattern make it uncertain. Assuming the last consistent increment of 5 (from 32 to 39) and then 44 (from 39 to 44 +5) the next increment might be +5 again leading to 49. However this is speculative due to the irregularities in the data. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,49

Without knowing the exact details of what 'R' represents I will provide a general reasoning based on the information given. In general it seems that choosing 'R1' leads to a lower travel distance when the opponent also chooses 'R1'. However when the opponent chooses 'R2' both 'R1' and 'R2' result in similar travel distances. Therefore when the opponent's last move was 'R1' it is better to choose 'R1' to minimize travel distance. When the opponent's last move was 'R2' either 'R1' or 'R2' can be chosen as they result in similar travel distances. Based on this reasoning I will provide the JSON object with the value being the recommended 'R' choice.,3,55

In the first scenario since there is no previous move from 'you' we can't make a decision based on that. In the second scenario since the 'opponent' picked R1 and 'you' picked R1 and the distance is 7 it seems like R1 is a shorter route. In the third scenario the 'opponent' picked R2 but 'you' picked R1 and the distance is 10 which is less than the previous scenario's distance of 12 when the opponent picked R2. In the fourth scenario the 'opponent' picked R1 and 'you' picked R1 and the distance is 17 which is more than the previous scenario's distance of 10 when 'you' picked R1.

The goal is to determine which route was chosen last by the opponent based on the given information. In this specific scenario it is always raining and the last moves suggest a pattern where the player who chooses R2 tends to increase the travel distance more than the player who chooses R1. In the last situation when the 'travel so far' value is 60 and the last moves are 'you R2 opponent R2' picking R2 would maintain the pattern of increasing the distance more than R1. However since the goal is to minimize the travel distance I will choose R1 in this situation. This reasoning is based on the assumption that the pattern of moves is indicative of the total distance traveled and that choosing R1 may result in a shorter overall distance. Note that this reasoning is based on the given sequence and may not hold true for all possible sequences.,3,63

The 'last moves' refer to the previous choices you and your opponent (whose choices are unknown to you) have made. The 'travel so far' indicates the total distance covered so far in the journey.  In general the best strategy is to choose the route that has not been chosen by the opponent in the last move as this allows you to avoid any delays or congestion they may have caused. However if you and your opponent have both chosen the same route in the last move it is best to switch to the other route to avoid potential congestion.  In this specific case the best choice for each scenario is as follows:  1. Pick 1 (R1) 2. Pick 1 (R1) 3. Pick 2 (R2) 4. Pick 1 (R1) 5. Pick 2 (R2) 6. Pick 1 (R1) 7. Pick 1 (R1) 8. Pick 2 (R2) 9.

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The situation describes a scenario where it's raining and the user is driving from point A to point B. The last moves indicate that the user has not made any move (you None) and the opponent's move is unknown. The travel distance so far is 0 meaning the journey has just started. The user is presented with two options: R1 or R2. Given the lack of specific information about the opponent's strategy the environment (rain) and the fact that no moves have been made yet the best approach is to choose a route that minimizes risk. In rainy conditions safety is a priority so selecting a route that is likely to be less affected by the rain or has better visibility would be ideal. However without specific details on what R1 and R2 entail the decision is based on default assumptions. Assuming R1 and R2 are both viable routes and there's no prior information to favor one over the other the choice is arbitrary. Therefore the value is chosen as 1 which corresponds to R1.,3,3

Since we are driving from A to B and considering the travel distance so far is 3 I need to make a decision on whether to continue with R1 or switch to R2. The choice might depend on factors like road conditions traffic and personal preference for handling rain.

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this scenario a rational choice would be to minimize the total distance traveled. The 'you' moves represent the user's choices and the 'opponent' moves represent the choices of the other party. The 'travel so far' value represents the cumulative distance traveled based on the last moves. Since it's raining and the user is driving choosing the same route as the opponent (R1 or R2) allows for continuing the journey with dry roads while changing routes (R1 to R2 or vice versa) might lead to driving on wet roads and reduced speed. Therefore when the opponent chooses R1 or R2 the user should also choose that option to maintain or increase the 'travel so far' value. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,59

12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a situation where two entities are driving from point A to point B in the rain with each making a series of moves (R1 or R2) and accumulating a 'travel so far' distance. The task is to determine the next move (R1 or R2) based on the pattern of previous moves and the accumulated distance. The 'travel so far' increases by varying amounts (3 7 3 7 5 3 5 7 5 7 7) with each move. The pattern of moves alternates between R1 and R2 but not strictly. The last move was R1 and the opponent's last move was R1. The accumulated distance is 59 and the next move is to be chosen between R1 and R2. The reasoning is that the pattern of moves and distances does not follow a strict sequence and the next move is likely to be R1 as it was the last move made by both the user and the opponent and the distance has increased by 7 in the previous step. However the pattern of distances is not consistent so the next move could be either R1 or R2. The value is 1 indicating the choice of R1.,7,66

Therefore choosing R1 is the optimal choice in these cases to minimize travel distance.,6,30
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The opponent has alternated between R1 and R2 in previous moves suggesting a pattern. Since R1 is the main road and may be blocked but the opponent took R1 last it might be a trap. However the total travel increments by 4 each time indicating a consistent path.

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,When total travel is 0 or the last move was not made choosing the main road (R1) is risky as it may be blocked. Therefore we should choose the alternative road (R2). When total travel is greater than 0 and the last move was not R1 we should consider the current state of the main road. If the main road has not caused any hindrance in the past (total travel is still small) we can try using the main road (R1) to save time.

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The opponent's recent use of R1 suggests it is not blocked as they would not take it if it were. The user should prioritize the main road (R1) for efficiency unless there's clear evidence of a blockage.

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The opponent's last move was R2 suggesting they may be avoiding R1 (which is marked as possibly blocked). To counter this and potentially use the main road if it's clear choosing R1 (option 1) aligns with the pattern of taking the opposite route from the opponent. This minimizes risk if R1 is unblocked while avoiding potential congestion on R2.,2,28
8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Given the pattern of travel and the fact that the main road (R1) has been chosen multiple times despite the possibility of it being blocked it seems that the main road is likely not blocked.

10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario presents a route selection problem between Point A and Point B with two possible roads: R1 (main road possibly blocked) and R2 (alternative road). The decision to choose R1 or R2 depends on the history of moves the total travel distance and the risk of R1 being blocked. The pattern of choices suggests that when both the player and the opponent have used R2 the player tends to switch to R1 possibly to avoid congestion or to take advantage of the main road if it's clear. However when the opponent has used R1 the player tends to avoid it possibly due to the risk of it being blocked. The total travel distance increases with each move indicating that the player is trying to minimize travel time or distance. The last move was the player choosing R2 and the opponent choosing R1 with a total travel of 36. Based on the previous pattern the player might choose R1 in this case assuming that the opponent's use of R1 might indicate that it's clear or that the player wants to avoid further congestion on R2. However since R1 is the main road and may be blocked the player might prefer R2 to avoid the risk. The decision is not straightforward but based on the previous choices the player might choose R1 if they believe it's clear or R2 if they want to avoid the risk. Given the previous choices the player might be more inclined to choose R1 in this case as they have used R1 in previous moves when the opponent used R2 possibly to avoid congestion on R2. However the risk of R1 being blocked is a factor so the player might choose R2 to ensure a safe route. The final decision depends on the player's risk tolerance and the likelihood of R1 being blocked. Based on the previous pattern the player might choose R1 in this case as they have done so when the opponent used R2 in previous moves.,6,42

In the second scenario you already took R2 and the opponent took R1 resulting in a travel distance of 4. Since the opponent has already taken R1 it is better to take the alternative route (R2) to avoid following the same path. In the third scenario both you and the opponent have already traveled on R1 so changing to R2 will not reduce the total travel of 10. Therefore it is best to stay on R1 in this case.,4,14

The last moves indicate that both the user and the opponent have been using R2 in recent turns suggesting a possible pattern or strategy. The total travel distance has been increasing and the choice between R1 and R2 depends on whether R1 is blocked or not. Since R1 is the main road and may be blocked but there's no explicit confirmation of it being blocked the safest choice is to continue using R2 to avoid potential delays or obstacles.

Therefore when total travel is 40 it is better to choose R2. In this case since the last moves are you: R2 opponent: R1 and total travel is 40 the best choice is R2.,4,44
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The scenario presents a route selection problem between Point A and Point B with two possible roads: R1 (main road possibly blocked) and R2 (alternative road). The decision to choose R1 or R2 depends on the history of moves the status of R1 and the total travel distance. The key factors to consider are: 1. R1 is the main road but may be blocked. If it is blocked using it would be inefficient or impossible. 2. The last moves of both the user and the opponent provide insight into the possible status of R1. If the opponent has used R1 recently it might be blocked or if the user has used R2 it might be a safer choice. 3. The total travel distance is increasing which suggests that the route selection is part of a larger journey and efficiency is important. 4. The pattern of choices shows that the user has been using R2 more frequently possibly due to R1 being blocked or unreliable. 5. The opponent's moves also influence the decision. If the opponent has used R1 it might be a sign that it is open or it might be a trap. 6. The total travel distance is a cumulative measure and the user is likely trying to minimize the total distance traveled. Based on the pattern of choices the user has been using R2 more frequently which suggests that R1 might be blocked or unreliable. Therefore the optimal choice would be to continue using R2 to avoid the risk of R1 being blocked and to maintain a consistent and efficient route.,4,40

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The scenario presents a route selection problem between Point A and Point B with two possible roads: R1 (main road possibly blocked) and R2 (alternative road). The decision must be based on the history of moves total travel and the risk of R1 being blocked. The last moves and total travel suggest a pattern of alternating routes possibly to avoid blockage. The opponent's moves also influence the choice as both players are likely trying to optimize their path. Given that R1 is the main road and may be blocked but has been used in previous moves (e.g. when total travel was 10 the user chose R1) it might be the more efficient route if unblocked. However since R1 is marked as possibly blocked the safer choice might be R2. The total travel distance increases with each move indicating that the game is progressing and the players are likely trying to minimize travel while avoiding blockage. The last move was R2 for both the user and opponent with total travel at 24. If R1 is blocked choosing R2 would be the logical choice. However if R1 is not blocked it might be more efficient. The decision hinges on whether R1 is blocked which is uncertain. Given the uncertainty the safer route is R2.,4,28

Following the pattern if the next move is R1 the total would increase by 2 making it 26 and if R2 it would increase by 4 making it 28. However the question is to pick either R1 or R2 not to predict the next total. The value to pick is based on the previous choices and the pattern. The last move was R2 by the player and R1 by the opponent and the total was 24. The next move is to pick either R1 or R2. Based on the pattern the player has been choosing R2 more often and the opponent has been alternating between R1 and R2. The next logical choice for the player might be R1 to balance the pattern but it's not certain. However the question is to pick one so the value is either 1 or 2.

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Without information on the current location (A) and the destination (B) along with the specific movement dynamics (R1 R2) it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the travel time. Furthermore the involvement of an unknown opponent and the lack of recent moves (none from you unknown from opponent) add to the uncertainty. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,4
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The scenario describes a nighttime drive from point A to B with no prior moves made by the user and an unknown opponent. The total travel distance is 0 implying the journey has just begun. The choice between routes R1 and R2 is presented. Given the lack of information about the opponent's strategy or the specific conditions of the routes the decision must be based on default assumptions. In such scenarios selecting the first available option (R1) is a common default strategy when there's no additional data to favor one route over the other. This approach minimizes decision delay and assumes that R1 might be the more straightforward or safer choice initially especially under the conditions of nighttime driving where visibility and potential hazards are factors. However this choice is provisional and may be revisited as more information becomes available about the opponent's actions or the route conditions.,2,2
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Given the last moves you chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 resulting in a travel total of 2. To maximize progress I will choose R1 again as it aligns with my previous move and may lead to a more consistent path.,2,4
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The previous move was R2 which means we are currently on route 2. Since the travel total is 4 that means we have moved 4 miles which is exactly the distance from A to the intersection of R1 and R2. Since it's night and the destination B is far away it would be best to continue on the same route to make progress rather than switching to R1 and starting over. Therefore the optimal move is to continue on R2.,4,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a situation where two entities are driving from point A to point B at night. The 'last moves' indicate the recent actions taken by both the driver (you) and the opponent. The 'travel total' represents the cumulative distance covered so far. The options provided (Pick 1 = R1 2 = R2) suggest that there are two possible routes or maneuvers to choose from. The reasoning involves analyzing the previous moves and the total travel distance to determine the most optimal next action. In the first scenario with no prior moves and zero travel distance the choice is arbitrary. In the second scenario with the driver taking R1 and the opponent taking R2 and a total travel of 2 units the decision might be influenced by the need to avoid collision or to optimize the route based on the opponent's actions.,6,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,Based on the pattern of the last moves it seems that the opponent is consistently choosing R2 after the user chooses R1. This could indicate a strategy where the opponent is trying to counter the user's move. Given this it might be beneficial to continue with R1 to see if the opponent continues to choose R2 or to switch to R2 to potentially disrupt the pattern.,6,10
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize the travel distance by choosing the correct route. In the first scenario since there is no information about the opponent's last move we choose R1 to start with. In the second scenario the last moves are the same (R2 R2) so to minimize the travel distance we should choose the other option which is R1. In the third scenario the last moves are different (R2 R1) so we should continue on the same route to minimize backtracking which means choosing R2.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Based on the previous moves where both the user and opponent chose R1 leading to a higher travel total of 8 switching to R2 might help avoid congestion or optimize the route. The opponent's last move was R1 so selecting R2 could be a strategic choice to minimize travel time or distance.,4,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the pattern of the last moves it seems that the opponent is alternating between R1 and R2. Since the last move was R1 the opponent is likely to choose R2 next.,4,14
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize travel distance. In the first scenario since there is no previous move either route can be chosen. In the second scenario the opponent chose R2 so it is best to choose R1 to minimize the total distance. In the third scenario the player chose R2 and the opponent chose R1 making the total distance 8. In this case it is still best to choose R1 to try to minimize the total distance. In the fourth scenario the player chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 making the total distance 10. Again it is best to choose R1 to try to minimize the total distance.,6,16
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both drivers choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel total increases by 4 (from 0 to 4 8 to 12). When they choose different routes the travel total increases by 2 (from 0 to 2). The next move should be R1 to maintain the pattern of increasing by 4 when both choose the same route.,6,18
5,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The driver has been alternating between R1 and R2 and the total travel distance is increasing. The driver seems to be trying to find a balance between the two routes. Given the current situation the driver should continue with R1 to maintain consistency and potentially reduce the total travel distance.,2,16
5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize the travel distance. If the opponent chooses R2 it results in a greater distance traveled. Therefore the optimal choice is R1. The reasoning behind the value returned is based on the travel total: if the total travel is 16 or more the opponent has already made poor choices so we can pick either R1 or R2 without increasing the total distance. However to minimize the distance we should still choose R1.,2,18
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each time the same move is chosen by both the driver and the opponent the total increases by a certain amount. For example when both chose R1 the total went from 0 to 2 then to 8 then to 18. The differences between these totals are 2 6 and 10 which form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. If this pattern continues the next difference would be 14 making the next total 18 + 14 = 32. Therefore if both choose R1 again the travel total would likely be 32.

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize the travel distance. When the opponent chooses R2 it results in a greater total distance. Therefore when the opponent chose R2 in the last move it is better to pick R1 to minimize the total distance. However when the player chose R2 in the last move and the opponent chose R1 the total distance is less than if both had chosen R1. Therefore if the player chose R2 in the last move and the opponent chose R1 the best option is to pick R2 again. The same applies if the player chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 as the total distance is still less than if both had chosen R2.,2,20
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each time the same move is chosen consecutively the total increases by 6 (from 0 to 2 2 to 8 8 to 12 12 to 18 18 to 22). However when the move changes the increase is different. The last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1. Based on the pattern the next move should be R1 to continue the sequence.,2,24

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The goal is to minimize the travel distance. In the given scenarios taking route 1 (R1) results in a lower total travel distance when the last moves were equal or when the player took R2 and the opponent took R1. Taking route 2 (R2) is only beneficial if the player took R2 and the opponent took R1 making the total travel distance 4. However in the last scenario the total travel distance is 20 and taking R1 (18) is still a better option than taking R2 (22). (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,24

When the move alternates the increase is 4 (e.g. 2 to 8 18 to 22 22 to 24). However the last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R2. Following the pattern if the same move is chosen again the travel total should increase by 6 making the next total 28 + 6 = 34. If R1 is chosen the increase would be 4 making it 28 + 4 = 32. Since the pattern shows that when the same move is repeated the increase is 6 the next move should be R2 again leading to a travel total of 34. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,32

However without more context on what R1 and R2 represent (e.g. speed settings route options) it's difficult to make an informed decision.

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this situation the optimal strategy is to minimize the number of moves while still trying to reach the destination before the opponent. If the total travel distance is even it's better to choose R1; if it's odd R2 is the better choice. This is because R1 always reduces the total distance by an even number (2 or 4) while R2 reduces it by an odd number (2) and keeps the total distance odd. The opponent can only match your move if the total distance is even so choosing R1 in that situation would give you an advantage.,4,30

Therefore if the opponent took R2 in the last move we should pick R1. If we took R2 in the last move we should pick R1 to prevent the opponent from adding 8 to the total. In other cases we can pick either R1 or R2 as they result in the same total travel distance.,6,36

5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each time the same move is chosen by both the driver and the opponent the total increases by a certain amount. For example when both chose R1 the total went from 0 to 2 then to 8 then to 18. The differences between these totals are 2 6 and 10 which form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. If this pattern continues the next difference would be 14 making the next total 18 + 14 = 32. Therefore if both choose R1 again the travel total would likely be 32.

However when different moves are chosen the increase is 2 (from 0 to 2 then 6 when same again etc.). The last move was R2 by both and the total is 22. Following the pattern if the same move (R2) is chosen again the total would increase by 6 making it 28. If a different move (R1) is chosen the increase would be 2 making it 24.

Since the pattern shows that switching routes adds 6 and the last move was R2 choosing R1 would result in a higher total. Therefore the next value is 34 if R2 is chosen again but since the question asks for the next value after the last move which is R2 the answer is 34. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,34

Choosing R1 again might maintain the current pace while choosing R2 could potentially increase the speed or change the route. However without more context on what R1 and R2 represent (e.g. speed settings route options) it's difficult to make an informed decision.

In the second scenario 'you' chose R2 and the opponent chose R1 so it's clear that R1 was the road taken by an opponent from 'A' to 'B'.

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize the travel distance.

When they choose different routes the travel total increases by 14. The last move was you R2 opponent R1 which resulted in a 14 increase. If the next move is R1 the total would be 18 + 14 = 32. If it's R2 the total would be 18 + 6 = 24. Since the pattern suggests that choosing the same route as the opponent leads to a smaller increase the optimal choice would be R2 to minimize the travel total. However the question is to predict the next travel total not the optimal choice. The last move was you R2 opponent R1 and the next choice is between R1 and R2. If the next choice is R1 the total would be 18 + 14 = 32. If it's R2 the total would be 18 + 6 = 24. The pattern doesn't indicate a preference for R1 or R2 so the next travel total could be either 24 or 32.

Based on the given information we can see that choosing the first route option (R1) results in a lower total distance when the opponent has chosen the first route option (R1) more times than you. Therefore if you want to minimize the total distance you should choose the first route option (R1) when the opponent has chosen the first route option (R1) more times than you and choose the second route option (R2) otherwise.,6,36

However when the driver chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R1 the travel total increases by 4 (from 0 to 6).

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize travel distance by taking turns with an opponent with each person choosing to move either 1 or 2 units forward at each turn. The reasoning here involves comparing the travel distances for each choice and selecting the option that results in a shorter total distance. 1. If the last moves were 'you None opponent Unknown' it means you haven't moved yet and the opponent moved 2 units. In this case moving 1 unit (R1) will result in a total travel distance of 1 while moving 2 units (R2) will result in a total travel distance of 3. Choosing R1 minimizes the total distance so the value is 1. 2. If the last moves were 'you R1 opponent R2' it means you moved 1 unit and the opponent moved 2 units. In this case moving 1 unit (R1) will result in a total travel distance of 4 while moving 2 units (R2) will result in a total travel distance of 6. Choosing R1 minimizes the total distance so the value is 1. 3. If the last moves were 'you R2 opponent R2' it means you and the opponent both moved 2 units. In this case moving 1 unit (R1) will result in a total travel distance of 9 while moving 2 units (R2) will result in a total travel distance of 10. Choosing R1 does not minimize the total distance so the value is 2.,2,8
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Both the user and opponent previously chose R1 leading to a travel total of 8.

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize travel distance. If the opponent chooses R2 it's better to choose R1 to minimize the total distance. However if the opponent chooses R1 either option is the same.

The 'value' key represents the choice between R1 and R2 where 1 is R1 and 2 is R2.,6,14
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each move adds a certain value. From 0 to 2 (R1) then 2 to 8 (R1) then 8 to 12 (R2). The increments are 2 6 4.

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each move adds a certain number of units to the total.

The increments are not consistent but there's a possible pattern where R1 adds 2 R2 adds 4 and sometimes R1 adds 6. However the most recent move was R1 adding 2 to reach 18. If the pattern continues the next move might be R2 adding 4 making the total 22. But since the increments are inconsistent it's hard to predict with certainty. The safest choice might be R1 again as it has been used more recently and added a smaller increment possibly indicating a safer or more consistent path.,6,24

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The goal is to minimize the travel total. When the opponent chooses R2 it results in a higher travel total.

Based on this analysis the best pick would be the one that maintains the lower travel total and avoids the 'you R1 opponent R1' scenario.,4,26
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each time the same move is chosen (R1 or R2) consecutively the travel total increases by 4.

There is no increase in 'travel total' when I choose R1 (option 1) and the opponent's last move is R2.

The value provided is 2 which corresponds to the travel total in the second scenario indicating that the user's choice of R1 has led to a positive outcome.

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The problem seems to be a route recommendation based on a two-player game on the way from A to B where each player can choose either R1 or R2 route and the travel total is the cumulative distance of all routes chosen by both players. The goal is to minimize the travel total. Given the last moves of both players and the current travel total the task is to decide the best route to pick next.,6,20
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel total increases by 4. When they choose different routes the increase is 2. Starting from 0 after choosing R1 and R2 it goes to 2. Then when both choose R2 it increases by 4 to 6 then again by 4 to 10 and then by 4 to 14. Following this pattern if the next move is R2 again the total would be 14 + 4 = 18. If the next move is R1 it would be 14 + 2 = 16. Since the last move was both choosing R2 the next logical step is to choose R2 again leading to a total of 18. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,18

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of the travel total increments is 0 2 6 10 14 16. The difference between each step is +2 +4 +4 +4 +2. It seems that after the initial steps the increment stabilizes at +4 but the last step only increased by +2. This might indicate a possible error or a change in the pattern. However following the previous consistent +4 increments the next logical step would be to add 4 to the last travel total of 16 resulting in 20. Therefore the next travel total is predicted to be 20.

10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the travel total increases by 4 each time. For example from 0 to 4 (but first instance is 0 then 2 6 10 14 16 20 24 28 32). However there are inconsistencies. The first move is None vs Unknown with total 0. Then R1 vs R2 gives 2 R2 vs R1 gives 6 R2 vs R2 gives 10 R2 vs R1 gives 14 R1 vs R2 gives 16 R2 vs R2 gives 20 R2 vs R2 gives 24 R2 vs R1 gives 28 R2 vs R2 gives 32. The increments between R2 vs R2 are 4 each time (10 14 16 20 24 28 32). But between other moves the increments vary. The next move after 32 would be R2 vs R2 again so adding 4 would make it 36. But the user is asked to pick R1 or R2. If the user picks R2 the total would be 36. If they pick R1 it's unclear but the pattern might not follow the same increment. However the last move was R2 vs R2 with total 32 so the next R2 vs R2 would be 36. But the user is the one making the choice so if they pick R2 the total would be 36. If they pick R1 maybe it's different. But the question is to predict the next travel total based on the pattern. The last total is 32 and the next move is R2 vs R2 so adding 4 gives 36.

3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when the user picks R1 the travel total increases by 2 and when they pick R2 it increases by 4. The opponent's move seems to be the opposite of the user's previous move. So if the user picks R1 now the travel total would be 6 + 2 = 8 and if they pick R2 it would be 6 + 4 = 10.

Since 3 is not a multiple of the current total + 2 the opponent must have moved to R2 and you should move to R1.,2,26
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of travel totals suggests that each round (R1 or R2) adds a certain number of points. Observing the sequence: when you pick R1 and opponent R2 the total increases by 2 (from 0 to 2). When you pick R2 and opponent R1 it increases by 6 (from 2 to 6). Then again when you pick R2 and opponent R1 it increases by 4 (from 6 to 10). Next when you pick R1 and opponent R2 it increases by 2 (from 10 to 12). Now when both pick R2 the total increases by 4 (from 12 to 16). It seems that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel total increases by 4. If the opponent chooses R2 and you choose R1 the increase is 2. If the opponent chooses R1 and you choose R2 the increase is 6. Based on this pattern if the opponent chooses R2 and you choose R1 the travel total would increase by 2 making the next total 18. However if the opponent chooses R1 and you choose R2 the increase would be 6 making the next total 22. Since the opponent's choice is unknown but the last move was both choosing R2 it's possible that the next move might follow the same pattern. If the opponent chooses R2 again the increase would be 4 making the next total 20. However if the opponent chooses R1 the increase would be 6 making the next total 22.

If the opponent's last move was 'R2' then the optimal move is 'R1' because it results in a higher travel total and in this scenario a higher travel total is better for the player. This is because the player will have more distance to travel before reaching the destination and since many drivers are going from A to B it is assumed that reaching the destination first provides some sort of advantage such as winning the game or receiving a reward.,4,30

However the last move shows that the user chose R1 and the opponent chose R2 resulting in a travel total of 32. Since the user is now at 32 and the options are to pick R1 or R2 the next move would depend on the pattern. If the pattern continues the next increase might be 2 again but it's not clear.

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario describes a situation where multiple drivers are traveling from point A to point B on a festival day. The 'Last moves' indicate the previous actions taken by the user and the opponent and 'Travel total' shows the cumulative progress made. The options given are to pick either R1 or R2 which likely represent different routes or actions. The first scenario shows that the user has not made a move (you None) and the opponent's move is unknown (opponent Unknown) with a travel total of 0. In the second scenario the user has taken R1 and the opponent has taken R2 resulting in a travel total of 2. Based on this it seems that each move contributes to the travel total and the goal is to reach point B. The reasoning would involve analyzing the possible outcomes of choosing R1 or R2 considering the previous moves and the travel total.

It seems that the travel total increases by 6 when both choose R1 but when you choose R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the increase is 10. However when you choose R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the increase is 2. Therefore to maximize the travel total I should choose R1 when the opponent chooses R1 and R2 when the opponent chooses R1.

10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The strategy of the opponent and the current travel total are the key factors in deciding the next move. If the opponent chose R2 on their last move it seems to result in a higher travel total so the optimal move seems to be R1. However there are cases where choosing R2 results in a lower total. To minimize the travel total we need to consider the possibility of the opponent choosing R1 after our R2. Based on this analysis the best move to minimize the travel total is to pick the option with the lower additional travel distance compared to the current total.,2,36

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Since it's a festival day we can assume that there will be more drivers traveling from point A to B. As the last move was made by the opponent and the total travel distance is 0 it's a good opportunity to make the first move and take advantage of the increased traffic. I will choose a random route either R1 or R2 to maximize our chances of gaining an advantage over the opponent.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The scenario describes a situation where multiple drivers are moving from point A to B and the last moves indicate that the user has not moved (you None) while the opponent's move is unknown. The total travel distance is 0 suggesting that no progress has been made yet. Given the options to pick either R1 or R2 the decision would be based on typical strategies in such scenarios. Since there's no prior movement and the opponent's action is unknown choosing R1 might be a safer initial move to establish a path or strategy. However without additional context on what R1 and R2 represent (like routes strategies or actions) this is an assumption based on common decision-making in similar situations.,2,2

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The scenario describes a situation where multiple drivers are traveling from point A to point B on a festival day. The 'Last moves' indicate the previous actions taken by the user and the opponent and 'Travel total' shows the cumulative progress made. The options given are to pick either R1 or R2 which likely represent different routes or actions. The first scenario shows that the user has not made a move (you None) and the opponent's move is unknown (opponent Unknown) with a travel total of 0. In the second scenario the user has taken R1 and the opponent has taken R2 resulting in a travel total of 2. The reasoning here is that the user's choice of R1 in the second scenario has contributed to the travel total suggesting that R1 might be a more effective or faster route. However since the opponent's move is unknown in the first scenario it's unclear what the optimal choice would be. The value provided is 2 which corresponds to the travel total in the second scenario indicating that the user's choice of R1 has led to a positive outcome.,4,6

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The strategy takes into account the day being a festival indicating heavy traffic from drivers going from A to B. The opponent's last move and the current travel total are also considered. If the opponent chose R1 and the travel total is 6 then picking R1 again is a better option due to lower travel distance compared to R2. If the opponent chose R1 and the travel total is 10 then picking R2 is a better option to avoid the heavy traffic caused by the festival. The goal is to minimize travel distance based on the given conditions.,6,16
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel total increases by 4 (from 0 to 2 when both chose R1 then from 2 to 6 when both chose R2). If they choose different routes the travel total increases by 2 (from 0 to 2 when user chose R1 and opponent R2). Based on this if both choose R2 again the travel total would increase by 4 again making it 6 + 4 = 10. However if the user chooses R1 and the opponent chooses R2 the travel total would increase by 2 making it 6 + 2 = 8. Since the user is trying to maximize their travel total they should choose R2 to get the higher increase of 4 resulting in a travel total of 10.,4,10

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Since Route 1 may have an accident and taking Route 1 would result in more total travel distance based on previous moves it is safer to pick Route 2.

3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario presents a decision-making process involving two routes R1 and R2 with potential risks and travel distances. The key factors to consider are the possibility of an accident on Route 1 and the total travel distance. Initially when no moves have been made the choice is between R1 (with a risk of accident) and R2 (presumably safer but with unknown travel distance). After the first move choosing R1 leads to a total travel of 3 while choosing R2 leads to 8. This suggests that R1 is shorter but riskier while R2 is longer but safer. In the third scenario the last moves were you R2 and opponent R1 with a total travel of 8. This indicates that taking R2 has led to a longer travel distance but it might be safer. The decision to pick R1 or R2 depends on the trade-off between the risk of an accident and the travel distance. If the priority is to minimize travel distance R1 might be preferred despite the risk. However if safety is a higher priority R2 would be the better choice. The total travel distance also plays a role in this decision as R1 has a shorter distance but with a risk while R2 is longer but safer. The choice between R1 and R2 depends on the individual's risk tolerance and the importance of minimizing travel distance versus ensuring safety.,5,13

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When your total travel distance is less than or equal to 16 picking Route 1 has a higher chance of leading to a shorter overall travel distance taking into account the potential accident on Route 1. However when the total travel distance exceeds 16 picking Route 2 becomes the better option due to the reduced travel distance on Route 2 compared to Route 1.,8,34
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the total travel increases by 5 (from 23 to 28). However when the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the total travel increases by 5 as well (from 18 to 23 23 to 28). This suggests that choosing R2 consistently leads to a 5-unit increase in total travel regardless of the opponent's choice. Therefore the optimal strategy is to choose R2 to maximize total travel.,5,33

This suggests that the total travel is increasing by 5 each time regardless of the choices but the choices themselves are alternating between R1 and R2. The last move was both choosing R2 and the next increase would be 5 making the total travel 38. Therefore the next choice is likely to be R1 to continue the alternating pattern.

The key factors to consider are the safety of the route and the pattern of previous choices. The initial state indicates that the user has not made a move yet and the opponent's move is unknown. As the total travel increases the user and opponent alternate between R1 and R2. The pattern suggests that when the user chooses R2 the opponent also chooses R1 and vice versa. This could indicate a strategic move to avoid R1 due to the potential accident. The total travel increases by 5 units each time which might represent the distance or time taken for each move. The decision to choose R1 or R2 may depend on the risk of an accident on R1 and the need to minimize travel. The user's previous move was R2 and the opponent's move was R1 which might suggest that the user is trying to avoid R1. The total travel is 18 which is the highest so far and the user is again presented with the choice between R1 and R2. Given the potential accident on R1 and the previous pattern of moves it is likely that the user would choose R2 to avoid the risk of an accident and continue with the higher total travel.,5,23

When the opponent chose Route 1 the total travel distance is already greater than the distance if Route 2 was chosen initially so it's safer to stick with Route 1 in that case.,5,25
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Both the user and opponent have last moved on R2 and Route 1 has a potential accident. Continuing with R2 avoids the risk of an accident on R1 making it the safer and more consistent choice.,5,28

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The question asks for a recommendation on which route to pick and provides information about possible accidents on Route 1 the previous moves made by the user and the opponent and the total travel distance so far. The goal is to minimize travel distance and avoid accidents. Since Route 1 may have an accident and the opponent has already chosen Route 2 in the previous moves it is safer to pick Route 2. Additionally choosing the same route as the opponent can help avoid traffic and reduce travel distance. Therefore the recommendation is to pick Route 2.,5,30
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R1 the total travel increases by 8. When the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R1 the total travel increases by 13. When the user chooses R2 and the opponent chooses R2 the total travel increases by 23. The difference between R1 and R2 choices seems to be 5 units. If the user chooses R1 the total travel would be 28 + 5 = 33. If the user chooses R2 the total travel would be 28 + 23 = 51. Since the user is trying to minimize the total travel they should choose R1.,8,36

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The reasoning is based on the assumption that Route 1 may have an accident which would cause longer travel time if chosen. The previous moves indicate that you have been on Route 2 and the opponent has been on Route 2 or Route 1.

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The input suggests a game scenario where two players are choosing between two routes (R1 and R2) and there is a possibility of an accident on Route 1. The decision on which route to pick may depend on the total travel so far and the previous moves of both players.  In this scenario I will assume the goal is to minimize total travel distance and avoid Route 1 if there is a chance of an accident.  Given the last move 'you' being R2 and 'opponent' being R1 with a total travel of 25 or more I recommend picking Route 1 (value: 1) because the opponent has already chosen Route 1 and choosing Route 2 would result in longer travel distance due to the accident on Route 1.  However if the total travel is less than 25 I would recommend picking Route 2 (value: 2) to avoid the potential accident on Route 1.,3,43

10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The input suggests that there is a 50% chance to pick either route 1 or route 2 and that route 1 may have an accident. As the total travel distance increases the risk of the accident becomes more significant when choosing route 1. However since the last moves were 'you R1 opponent R2' with a total travel distance of 43 it suggests that you are currently on route 1 and your opponent is on route 2. In this case even though route 1 may have an accident it would still be faster to continue on route 1 since changing to route 2 would mean adding the extra distance your opponent has already traveled. Therefore the value for this input is 1.,8,51

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Route 1 has a potential accident but no recent moves or opponent actions are known. Since total travel is 0 there's no prior data to suggest a higher risk.

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,When your total travel distance is 0 or 5 and the opponent has also chosen Route 2 it is safer to choose Route 1 to avoid potential accidents on Route 1. However when your total travel distance is 10 and the opponent has already chosen Route 2 twice choosing Route 1 or Route 2 could be equally risky. In this case I chose Route 2 to follow the opponent's path but the choice between Route 1 and Route 2 is less critical.,5,15
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario presents a decision-making process involving two routes (R1 and R2) with potential risks and accumulated travel distances. The key factors to consider are: 1. Risk of Accident on R1: The repeated mention of 'Route 1 may have an accident' indicates a consistent risk associated with R1. This suggests that R1 is inherently more dangerous or unreliable compared to R2. 2. Last Moves and Total Travel: The 'last moves' and 'total travel' data provide a historical context of the choices made. The first instance shows no prior movement the second shows both parties choosing R1 with a total travel of 8 and the third shows both choosing R2 with a total travel of 13. This implies that R2 while safer might be longer or less direct. 3. Decision Options: The options to pick R1 or R2 at each step suggest a need to balance risk and efficiency. Given the consistent risk on R1 and the increasing total travel on R2 the optimal choice would be to minimize risk while managing travel distance. 4. Strategic Consideration: If both parties have previously chosen R2 (with higher travel) and there's no indication of increased risk on R2 it might be safer to continue with R2. However if there's a need to reduce travel distance R1 might be considered despite the risk. 5. Conclusion: Based on the risk of accident on R1 and the previous choice of R2 with higher travel the safest and most logical choice is to continue with R2 to avoid the potential accident on R1 even though it results in higher travel distance.,5,18

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The scenario presents a decision-making process involving two routes (R1 and R2) with potential risks and accumulated travel distances. The key factors to consider are: 1. Risk of Accident on R1: R1 is marked as 'may have an accident' indicating a potential hazard. This suggests that choosing R1 carries a risk that could lead to a stop or delay. 2. Travel Distance: The total travel distance increases with each choice and the accumulated distances are 0 8 13 and 18. The higher the distance the more critical it becomes to avoid further risk. 3. Opponent's Moves: The opponent's previous moves influence the decision. If both parties have chosen R1 or R2 it might indicate a pattern or a shared risk. 4. Strategy: The optimal strategy would be to minimize risk while maximizing travel efficiency. Given that R1 has a potential accident risk and the accumulated travel distance is increasing the best choice would be to switch to R2 to avoid the risk and continue with a safer route. 5. Decision: Based on the above factors the best choice is to pick R2 (option 2) to avoid the potential accident on R1 and continue with a safer route considering the increasing travel distance and the need to minimize risk.,5,23

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,There is a chance that Route 1 may have an accident and no previous moves have been made yet. To avoid the potential accident we will choose Route 2. If there was no risk of an accident on Route 1 we would have an extra travel distance of 1 but since we are avoiding it the value is 0. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,5
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Route 1 has a potential accident but no recent moves or opponent actions are known. Since total travel is 0 there's no prior data to suggest a higher risk. Choosing R1 might be safe if the accident is not imminent. However without more information the decision is uncertain.,3,3
2,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Given the history of the game both players have chosen Route 2 (R2) in the last move and the total travel so far is 5. Since Route 1 (R1) has a potential accident it is safer to continue with Route 2 (R2) to avoid any risks.,5,10
2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The input suggests that there are two routes and the choice is between route 1 (R1) and route 2 (R2). In the first scenario you have not yet made a move and the opponent has also not made a move. However it is mentioned that route 1 may have an accident. In the second scenario you have chosen route 2 and the opponent has chosen route 1. Here the total travel is given as 5 which suggests that route 2 might be faster or more convenient than route 1. Therefore considering the potential accident on route 1 and the travel time difference I would recommend choosing route 2.,5,10
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user previously selected R1 despite the accident risk and the total travel is now 3. Continuing with R1 may align with the strategy of maximizing progress assuming the accident risk is manageable or the reward justifies it. Opponent's choice of R2 suggests a possible need to counterbalance or maintain momentum.,3,6

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The reason for the recommendation is that Route 1 may have an accident and even though taking Route 2 results in slightly more travel time it is a safer option. The opponent has already chosen Route 1 in the last move so if you also choose Route 1 you will be following the opponent and may be at risk if there is an accident. By choosing Route 2 you can avoid this risk and ensure a safer journey.,5,15
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario presents a situation where Route 1 (R1) may have an accident and the user is being asked to choose between R1 and R2. The 'last moves' and 'total travel' provide context about previous decisions and accumulated distance. The key factors to consider are: 1. The risk of an accident on R1 which suggests that R1 might be less safe or more prone to issues. 2. The 'last moves' indicate that the user has previously chosen R1 while the opponent has chosen R2. This could imply that the user is following a pattern but the opponent's choice might be more strategic. 3. The 'total travel' increases with each decision which might represent progress or distance covered. The user is being asked to pick again between R1 and R2 and the pattern of choices suggests that the user has been selecting R1 while the opponent has been selecting R2. Given the risk of an accident on R1 it might be safer to choose R2 to avoid potential issues. However the user's previous choices might indicate a preference for R1 which could be based on familiarity or other factors. The decision would depend on whether the user prioritizes safety (choosing R2) or consistency (choosing R1). Based on the information provided the safer choice would be R2 to avoid the potential accident on R1.,5,11

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The input describes four different scenarios with varying 'total travel' values and last moves for the user and opponent. The 'total travel' value represents the distance traveled so far in the route. The 'last moves' indicate the most recent decisions made by the user and opponent with 'you' being the user and 'opponent' being the other party. The options to pick from are Route 1 (R1) and Route 2 (R2). Given that Route 1 may have an accident it is safer to choose Route 2 in this scenario. Therefore the 'value' will be 2 representing Route 2 for all scenarios.,5,20

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The given scenario states that Route 1 may have an accident. To minimize the risk and travel time it is better to choose Route 2. The total travel distance increases by 5 units after each move and the opponent's moves do not affect the risk of the accident on Route 1. Therefore the suggested action is to pick Route 2.,5,30

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The input suggests that Route 1 may have an accident and provides different scenarios of previous moves and total travel distances. The value to return is based on the total travel distance when choosing Route 2 (R2). In this context the value of taking Route 2 given the circumstances seems to be related to the total travel distance and the previous moves of the opponent. For simplicity I will return the total travel distance as the value but a more sophisticated reasoning process might consider other factors such as the opponent's moves or the specific details of the accident.

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The input describes a situation where there are two routes (R1 and R2) and Route 1 may have an accident. The last moves were made by the user (you) choosing R2 and the opponent choosing R1 or R2. The total travel distance varies. The goal is to minimize total travel distance.  In this situation it is best to choose Route 1 as indicated by the 'value' key in the JSON object because even though Route 1 may have an accident the total travel distance will still be shorter than if Route 2 is chosen.  The reasoning behind this is that Route 1 is only 5 travel units away while Route 2 is already 20 or more travel units away. Therefore choosing Route 1 will minimize the total travel distance even if an accident occurs.  In general when facing a choice between two routes with uncertain conditions it is best to choose the route with the shorter distance as the potential delay from an accident will be outweighed by the time saved from traveling a shorter distance.,8,48

10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The input suggests that there is a possibility of an accident on Route 1. The total travel represents the distance already traveled on the current route. The last moves indicate the previous choices made by you and the opponent. Since the safety of Route 1 is uncertain it is reasonable to switch to Route 2. Therefore the value assigned to key 'value' is 2 suggesting to pick Route 2.,5,53
10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where the travel increases by 3 3 5 5 8 5 5 5 8. This suggests a repeating pattern of increments: 3 3 5 5 8 then repeating 5 5 5 8. The next increment after 47 would logically follow this pattern. If the pattern is 3 3 5 5 8 5 5 5 8 then the next increment after 47 would be 3 making the next total travel 50. However the pattern is not perfectly clear but the most likely next increment is 3 leading to 47 + 3 = 50. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,52

11,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The decision is based on the travel time and the last move made.

13,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The input suggests that there are two routes R1 and R2 and the last moves were made by the user (you) and an opponent.

13,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where choosing Route 1 (R1) and Route 2 (R2) alternately leads to different totals. Observing the increments: 0 to 3 (R1) 3 to 6 (R1) 6 to 11 (R2) 11 to 16 (R2) 16 to 24 (R1) 24 to 29 (R2) 29 to 34 (R2) 34 to 39 (R2) 39 to 47 (R1) 47 to 52 (R2) 52 to 57 (R2) 57 to 62 (R2). The increments when choosing R1 are 3 3 8 12 5 and when choosing R2 are 5 5 5 5 5 5. It seems that after a certain point choosing R2 consistently adds 5 to the total. The last move was R2 and the total is 62. If we continue the pattern the next increment after R2 would likely be 5 making the next total 67. However since the question is to pick between R1 and R2 and the last few moves have been R2 it might be a strategic move to switch to R1 to break the pattern and avoid potential accidents on R1.

1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Since Route 1 'may' have an accident it's safer to avoid it for now. The total travel distance is 0 so there's no penalty for switching routes. So let's switch to Route 2 for the time being.,5,5
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Route 1 has a potential accident risk but no recent moves or opponent actions are known. Since total travel is 0 there's no prior data to suggest a higher risk.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The input suggests that there are two routes 1 and 2 and that route 1 may be experiencing an accident. The 'last moves' indicate that taking route 2 may have been safer in the past. However it's important to consider the total travel time as well. In the first scenario no moves have been made yet so total travel time is 0. In the second scenario both the user and the opponent chose route 2 resulting in a travel time of 5. Since there is a risk associated with route 1 and route 2 has resulted in a shorter travel time in the past it is safer to choose route 2. Therefore the 'value' key is set to 2.,5,10

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,When your total travel distance is 0 or 5 and the opponent's last move is R2 choosing Route 2 may lead to the same congested route as the opponent causing a longer travel time. Therefore it is safer to choose Route 1 in these scenarios. However when your total travel distance is 10 and the opponent's last move is R1 choosing Route 1 would mean following the same route as the opponent which might have an accident. In this case choosing Route 2 is safer.,3,13
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The scenario presents a decision-making process involving two routes R1 and R2 with potential risks and travel distances. The key factors to consider are the possibility of an accident on Route 1 and the total travel distance. Initially when no moves have been made the choice is between R1 (with a risk of accident) and R2 (presumably safer but with unknown travel distance). After the first move choosing R1 leads to a total travel of 3 while choosing R2 leads to 8. This suggests that R1 is shorter but riskier while R2 is longer but safer. In the third scenario the last moves were you R2 and opponent R1 with a total travel of 8. This indicates that taking R2 has led to a longer travel distance but it might be safer. The decision to pick R1 or R2 depends on the trade-off between the risk of an accident and the travel distance. If the priority is to minimize travel distance R1 might be preferred despite the risk. However if safety is a higher priority R2 would be the better choice. The total travel distance also plays a role in this decision as R1 has a shorter distance but with a risk while R2 is longer but safer. The choice between R1 and R2 depends on the individual's risk tolerance and the importance of minimizing travel distance versus ensuring safety.,5,13

5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the total travel increases by 5 (from 13 to 18). If the user chooses R1 it might reset or follow a different pattern but since the last move was R2 for both continuing with R2 seems logical to maintain the increment. However the accident risk on R1 might influence the choice. But since the last move was R2 for both and the total travel increased by 5 it's likely the next choice is R2 again.,5,23

However if one of you has been on Route 1 recently it is better to switch to Route 2 (pick 2) to avoid the potential accident on Route 1.

However the increment from 23 to 26 is only 3 which breaks the pattern. This might indicate an error or a different rule. If we assume the pattern should continue with increments of 5 the next total travel should be 31 + 5 = 36. But since the last increment was 3 it's uncertain.

If we assume the pattern should continue with +5 the next total travel would be 36 + 5 = 41. But since the last increment was +5 (from 31 to 36) it's likely the next is 41.

10,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where choosing Route 1 (R1) adds 3 units when selected after R2 while Route 2 (R2) adds 5 units when selected after R2. However when R1 is chosen after R1 it adds 2 units and R2 after R1 adds 5 units. The last move was R2 and the total travel is 41. If R1 is chosen next it would add 3 units making the total 44. If R2 is chosen it would add 5 units making the total 46. Since the pattern suggests that R1 adds less when chosen after R2 it might be the optimal choice to minimize total travel. However the problem states that Route 1 may have an accident which introduces risk. If we prioritize safety R2 might be preferred despite higher travel. But the question seems to ask for the next move based on the pattern not risk. Hence based on the pattern R1 adds 3 R2 adds 5. The next move should be R1 to keep total travel lower.,8,49

12,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The input describes 12 scenarios each with a different total travel distance. The 'value' to return is based on the total travel distance and the route chosen (R1 or R2). In this case the optimal route is R1 as it is chosen in the reasoning for all scenarios with the lowest total travel distances. Therefore the 'value' will be the total travel distance for the scenarios where 'Pick 1 = R1'. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,67
12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where the travel increases by 3 5 5 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 8 5. This suggests that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the increment is different (3 5 or 8) while when they choose different routes the increment is consistently 5. The last move was you R2 opponent R1 with total travel 54. If you choose R1 the opponent might choose R2 again leading to a 5 increment making total travel 59. If you choose R2 the opponent might choose R1 leading to a 5 increment as well. However since the last same-route move had an 8 increment there might be a pattern where after a same-route move the next different-route move has a 5 increment. Given the last move was different (R2 vs R1) the next increment is likely 5 so choosing R1 would lead to 54 + 5 = 59 and R2 would also lead to 54 + 5 = 59. However since the opponent's last move was R1 if you choose R2 again the opponent might switch to R2 leading to a same-route move with a different increment. But based on the pattern the most consistent increment after a different move is 5 so the total travel would be 59 regardless. However the question asks for the next total travel and based on the last move being different (R2 vs R1) the next increment is likely 5 making the total travel 54 + 5 = 59.

13,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,When the total travel distance is small choosing Route 1 has a higher potential for saving time despite the risk of an accident. As the total travel distance increases the likelihood of saving time by choosing Route 1 decreases making Route 2 a more attractive option.

13,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where choosing Route 1 (R1) and Route 2 (R2) alternately increases the total travel by varying amounts.

The increments for R1 are 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 5 5 while for R2 they are 5 5 5 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 5. The most consistent increment for R1 is 5 and for R2 it's also 5. However there are occasional variations. The last move was R2 with a total travel of 59 and the next choice is between R1 and R2. Based on the most frequent increment of 5 the next total travel would be 59 + 5 = 64 if R1 is chosen or 59 + 5 = 64 if R2 is chosen. However since the last move was R2 and the pattern shows that after R2 the next move is often R1 which typically adds 5 the next total travel is likely 64.

However since the last move was both choosing R1 and the previous move had a total travel of 16 it's possible that the next total travel would be 32 if the pattern continues. But since the options are to pick R1 or R2 and the previous choices were R1 and R1 it's possible that the next choice would be R2 to avoid a potential accident on Route 1.

6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel seems to follow a sequence where each step increases by 5 then 5 then 8 then 5 then 5. However there's inconsistency in the increments. Alternatively looking at the last moves when both you and the opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel increases by 16 (from 0 to 16) and then by 10 (from 16 to 26). This suggests that when both choose the same route the total travel increases by 16 initially then by 10. If the next step is when both choose R2 following the last instance where both chose R2 (total travel 26) the next increase might be 10 again making the total travel 36.

7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When your total travel distance is already high and the opponent has been choosing Route 2 for a while it is safer to pick Route 1 to avoid the potential accident on Route 1. This is because the penalty for choosing Route 1 is a one-time 5-unit increase in travel distance while continuing to choose Route 2 increases your travel distance at the same rate as the penalty for Route 1. However if the opponent chooses Route 1 it is better to choose Route 2 to minimize the total travel distance.,8,41

The differences between consecutive values are 3 5 8 5 5 5 5. This suggests that after the initial steps the total travel increases by 5 each time.

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,When total travel is less than or equal to 44 choosing Route 1 has a higher risk of longer travel time due to potential accidents. Therefore to minimize travel time Route 2 is the better choice when total travel is less than or equal to 44. However when total travel is 44 or more choosing Route 1 or Route 2 has the same risk of longer travel time. Therefore either route is a valid choice when total travel is 44 or more.,5,49
9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel increments suggests a sequence where choosing Route 1 (R1) after certain moves leads to higher travel totals. Observing the progression when both you and the opponent choose R2 the total travel increases by 5 (from 26 to 31 36 to 41). However when the opponent chooses R1 and you choose R2 the increase is 5 as well (from 31 to 36). This suggests that the system may be rewarding consistent choices of R2 but with an accident risk on R1. The last move was you R2 opponent R2 with total travel 41. If we continue the pattern the next increment after 41 would likely be 46 if both choose R2 again but since the accident risk is mentioned for R1 it's safer to choose R2 to avoid potential disruptions. Thus the optimal choice is R2.,5,46

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The value of choosing Route 2 is always 0 when you have not moved yet because there is no travel distance. When both you and your opponent have chosen Route 2 the travel distance is 5. When you have chosen Route 2 and your opponent has chosen Route 1 the travel distance is 10. When you have chosen Route 1 and your opponent has chosen Route 2 the travel distance is 21. When both you and your opponent have chosen Route 1 the travel distance is 18. Therefore the value of choosing Route 1 or Route 2 depends on the travel distance and the previous moves of you and your opponent. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,26
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The pattern of total travel seems to follow a sequence where each increment adds 3 then 5 then 3 then 5 etc. Starting from 0 adding 3 gives 3 then adding 5 gives 8 then adding 3 gives 11 then adding 5 gives 16. Following this pattern the next increment should be 3 making the next total travel 19. Therefore the next move is likely to be R1 which adds 3 to the total travel.,3,19

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The reasoning is based on minimizing total travel distance and avoiding Route 1 if there is a possibility of an accident. If the opponent chose Route 2 in the last move then staying with Route 2 is beneficial because it is shorter than Route 1 and the opponent's choice indicates that Route 2 might be safer. However if the opponent chose Route 1 in the last move then switching to Route 2 is better to avoid the potential accident on Route 1.,8,34
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of total travel increments is 0 3 8 11 16 19. The differences between consecutive totals are 3 5 3 5 3. This suggests an alternating pattern of adding 3 and 5. Following this pattern the next increment should be 5 making the next total 19 + 5 = 24. Since the last move was you R1 opponent R2 and the pattern alternates between R1 and R2 the next move should be R2 for the opponent implying you should pick R1 again to continue the pattern.

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The reasoning is based on minimizing total travel distance and avoiding Route 1 due to the possibility of an accident. If you and the opponent both choose Route 2 your total travel distance will be less than if you both choose Route 1. Therefore the best choice is Route 2 in all cases except when your total travel distance is already high and changing to Route 1 will not significantly increase your total travel distance.,5,44
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of total travel increments by 5 each time when choosing R1 and by 4 when choosing R2. However the increments are not consistent. The last move was R2 with total travel 29. If we choose R1 next the increment would be 5 making total travel 34. If we choose R2 the increment would be 4 making total travel 33. Since the pattern is not clear but the last move was R2 it's possible that the next move is R1 to follow the alternating pattern. However the increments are inconsistent so it's hard to predict. The safest choice is R1 as it has been chosen more often.,8,37

The total travel distance has been increasing steadily and the opponent has been alternating between R1 and R2 which suggests that they might be trying to avoid the potential accident on R1. By consistently choosing R2 you can ensure a safer and more predictable travel route.,5,45
9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The route 1 has a higher chance of accident and even if the total travel distance is longer for route 2 it's safer to stick to route 1 to minimize the risk.

9,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel increments shows a sequence where the difference between each total travel increases by 5 each time. Starting from 0 the increments are 3 5 3 5 3 5 3 5 and the next increment should be 3 leading to a total travel of 37 + 3 = 40. However the last entry shows a total travel of 37 with the last moves being you R1 and opponent R1. If the pattern continues the next increment would be 5 making the total travel 37 + 5 = 42. But since the last increment before 37 was 3 (from 37 - 3 = 34) the next increment should be 5 leading to 37 + 5 = 42. However the user might be expecting the next increment to be 3 making it 40. Given the alternating pattern of 3 and 5 the next increment after 37 should be 5 resulting in 42. But the last move was both choosing R1 which might indicate a different pattern. Alternatively the total travel could be calculated as the sum of the previous total plus the next increment in the sequence. The increments are 3 5 3 5 3 5 3 5 so the next increment is 3 making the total 37 + 3 = 40. However the last increment before 37 was 3 (from 34 to 37) so the next should be 5 making it 42. This is a bit ambiguous but the most consistent pattern is alternating 3 and 5 so the next increment is 5 leading to 42. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),5,42

Since the total travel distance is increasing and the opponent has been consistently choosing Route 2 it is likely that the opponent will continue to choose Route 2 to avoid the potential accident. Therefore choosing Route 1 might be a strategic move to take advantage of the opponent's avoidance.,8,53
10,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The route 1 may have an accident and even if the total travel distance is already significant there is still a chance of avoiding further delay by switching to route 2. Also the opponent's moves do not provide a clear pattern to predict their choice.,5,57

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When your total travel distance is 0 or 5 and the opponent's last move is R2 choosing Route 2 may lead to the same congested Route 2 due to the opponent's last move. In this case it is safer to choose Route 1 to avoid potential accidents on Route 1. However when your total travel distance is 10 and the opponent's last move is R1 choosing Route 1 will lead to the same congested Route 1 due to the opponent's last move. In this case it is safer to choose Route 2 to avoid potential accidents on Route 1.,8,18
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The scenario presents a situation where Route 1 (R1) may have an accident and the decision to choose between R1 and R2 depends on the last moves and total travel. Initially when the total travel is 0 the choice is between R1 and R2. Then after moving R2 and the opponent moving R1 the total travel increases to 5 and then to 10. The pattern suggests that as the total travel increases the risk of choosing R1 (which may have an accident) might be higher. However the decision to pick R1 or R2 may depend on minimizing risk. Since the opponent has previously chosen R1 and the total travel is increasing it might be safer to continue with R2 to avoid the potential accident on R1. The value of 10 indicates the highest total travel and the choice here would be to pick R2 to avoid the accident risk.,5,15

The total travel distance increases by 5 units each time starting from 0 and reaching 15. The last moves indicate that both the user and the opponent have chosen R2 in the most recent scenario. Given that Route 1 has a risk of an accident and the user has previously chosen R2 it is logical to continue with R2 to avoid the risk.

Since the problem is deterministic and there's no information about accidents we'll assume both routes have an equal probability of accidents. Thus the optimal strategy is to minimize the total travel time.,5,39

The total travel increases by 5 each time suggesting a progression or accumulation of distance. Given that R1 is flagged as potentially having an accident the safer choice would be R2. The consistent selection of R2 by the user and the increasing total travel suggest a strategy to avoid R1 and accumulate travel distance through R2. Therefore the next logical choice is R2.,5,35

Based on the previous pattern if the player chooses R1 the total would be 12 + 2 = 14 and if they choose R2 it would be 12 + 6 = 18.

When the user chooses R2 and the opponent R1 the travel increases by 4 (from 2 to 6). Then when both choose R2 again it increases by 2 (from 6 to 8). This suggests that the travel distance is determined by the combination of moves with R2-R2 adding 4 R1-R2 adding 2 and R2-R1 adding 4. The final move is R2-R1 which adds 4 leading to a total of 32. The next move would be to choose R1 or R2 but since the pattern seems to be increasing by 4 when both choose R2 the next logical step would be to choose R2 again to continue the pattern. However since the last move was R2-R1 which added 4 the next move would be to choose R1 or R2. But based on the previous pattern the next move would be R2 to continue the sequence. However the total travel so far is 32 and the next move would be to choose R1 or R2. Since the pattern seems to be increasing by 4 when both choose R2 the next move would be R2 leading to a total of 36. But the user is asked to pick between R1 and R2 and the value is the total travel so far which is 32. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,36

Given that the travel distance so far is 2 (indicating that both travelers have moved once) the optimal move for the current traveler is to continue on R1. This is because switching to R2 would put the traveler at a disadvantage as they would be moving against the opponent's chosen route. By staying on R1 the traveler can maintain a steady pace and continue their commute to B.,6,8

4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of moves suggests a sequence where each move adds a certain value to the 'travel so far' metric. Analyzing the progression: starting from 0 after the first move (R1 or R2) it becomes 2 then 6 then 10. The increments are +2 +4 +4. This seems to follow a pattern where each move adds an increasing even number. If the next move is R1 the increment might be +6 (following the pattern of adding 2 more each time) leading to 10 + 6 = 16. If it's R2 the increment might be +8 leading to 10 + 8 = 18. However since the last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1 it's possible that the next move is R1 leading to 16. But without more context it's hard to be certain.

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When the last move by the opponent is 'R2' it is better to pick 'R1' to minimize the travel distance. This is because 'R1' is closer to the destination 'B' and will result in less overall travel distance. However when the last move by the opponent is 'R1' it is better to pick 'R2' to try and avoid the same choice as the opponent and potentially overtake them. The 'travel so far' value indicates the current total distance traveled which increases with each pick.,6,24
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of movement shows that when the opponent chooses R2 the travel distance increases by 4 (from 0 to 4 6 10 14).

Following the pattern the next move should be R1 to increase the travel by 2 making it 16. However the options are R1 and R2. Since the last move was R2 by the opponent the next move should be R1 to continue the pattern of alternating moves. Therefore the next move is R1.,6,20

The reasoning is based on the observed pattern of choices and the incremental increase in travel distance.,6,22
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this situation the optimal strategy is to always pick the route with the least total distance traveled so far regardless of the last moves.

Therefore the value will always be the number associated with the route that has been traveled the least so far.,2,32
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel so far shows that each time the user picks R2 they accumulate more distance. For instance after choosing R2 the travel distance increased from 0 to 2 then to 6 10 14 20 and 24. This suggests that R2 is the route that adds more distance each time. Therefore to maximize the travel distance the optimal choice would be to pick R2 again.,4,28

Therefore I will recommend 'R1' as the best move in this context.,6,38
8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of travel so far shows that each time the user chooses R2 they accumulate more distance. For instance after choosing R2 the travel increases by 6 then 10 then 14 then 20 then 24 then 28. This suggests that R2 is the route that leads to the maximum distance accumulation.

Based on the context the user should choose R1 to continue the commute.,6,6
1,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The input describes a game state where the user has not yet made a move and the opponent has made an unknown move. The user can choose to make their first move at either location R1 or R2. Since the travel distance is 0 the user can choose either option without affecting their travel distance. However since the opponent's move is unknown it may be strategically advantageous for the user to choose a location closer to the opponent's unknown position. Therefore the 'value' of each option depends on the expected location of the opponent's move. Without further information we cannot determine the exact value of each option but we can assume that the user should choose the option that is closer to the opponent's unknown position.,6,6
1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,The user is at the start of a commute with no prior moves and an unknown opponent. Since no specific strategy or context is provided the choice is arbitrary. R1 is selected as the initial move.,2,2

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The opponent has matched my previous move of R1 so it is likely that they will continue to choose R1. Also since this is a normal commute and we have only traveled 6 units so far I will choose the route that is more direct and familiar to me. Therefore I will pick R1 again.,6,12
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The user is on a normal commute from A to B. The last move was R1 and the opponent moved R2. The total travel so far is 2. The options are to pick R1 or R2 again. Since the user has already moved R1 and the opponent R2 the next logical step would be to continue with R1 to maintain consistency in movement. This would keep the travel path aligned with the previous move ensuring a smooth commute without unnecessary detours. Therefore the best choice is R1.,6,8
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,Based on the pattern of the last moves it seems that both you and your opponent have been alternating between R1 and R2. Since the last move was R2 it might be beneficial to switch to R1 to maintain the alternating pattern and potentially gain an advantage.,2,12
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The input describes a normal commute with the last moves being 'you R1 opponent R1'. This indicates that the user and the opponent both chose route 1 in the previous step. The travel so far is 12 which suggests that there has been some progress on the journey. Since both players have chosen route 1 in the last two steps it is likely that route 1 is the most efficient or direct route. Therefore the best pick for the next step should be route 1 again as it has proven to be a good choice in the past. Additionally choosing route 2 might lead to a longer or less efficient route which is not ideal when commuting.,2,14
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose the same route (R1 or R2) the travel distance increases by 8. When they choose different routes the travel distance increases by 2. Since the last move had both choosing R1 and the travel was 8 the next same choice would add another 8 making it 16. However the options are to pick R1 or R2. If the user picks R1 again the opponent's last move was R1 so same choice adding 8. If the user picks R2 different choice adding 2. But the question is to pick the next move not the result. The value is the number of the route chosen not the travel distance. The user's last move was R1 and the options are to pick R1 or R2. The reasoning is based on the pattern of travel distance but the value is the route number chosen. The user's next move is to pick either R1 or R2 so the value is 1 or 2. The reasoning is that the pattern of travel distance increases by 8 when same routes are chosen and 2 when different. The user's last move was R1 and the opponent's last move was R1. If the user picks R1 again the travel would be 8 + 8 = 16. If the user picks R2 the travel would be 8 + 2 = 10. But the question is to pick the next move not the travel distance. The value is the route number chosen so the answer is either 1 or 2. The reasoning is based on the pattern of travel distance but the value is the route number chosen.

The user is now choosing between R1 and R2. Based on the pattern the user seems to be alternating between R1 and R2 but the opponent's move was R2 which might suggest a need to switch to R1 to maintain balance or avoid repetition.,6,18

The 'travel so far' value represents the score with 14 being the current score. Given the current state the best move for the user is to continue playing rock (R1) to block the opponent's potential paper (R2) move. This strategy promotes a stable state and minimizes the risk of losing points. Therefore the 'value' key is set to 1 indicating the user should pick rock (R1).,6,20

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this game we are currently leading by 6 miles. The last move we made was R1 and our opponent also chose R1. This indicates that we are both taking a similar route but we are currently ahead. The question now is whether we should continue on the same route (R1) or switch to the other route (R2). Given that we are currently in the lead it seems strategically sound to stick with the route we're on and continue to build our lead. Therefore the value I will return is 1 indicating that we should choose R1 on our next move.,6,26

The opponent's moves alternate between R1 and R2. Currently you have traveled 26 units of distance and you are about to reach a point where you need to decide between route R1 or R2. Given the past moves it is likely that continuing on route R1 will allow you to maintain the current pace and possibly stay ahead or at par with your opponent. Therefore I recommend choosing route R1 to ensure a smooth commute.,2,28

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The optimal route to travel from A to B is to always choose the same route (R1) as the opponent has recently chosen as this will continue the commute along the same path and avoid changing routes. The 'travel so far' value indicates the total distance traveled which increases as the commute continues. The 'last moves' indicate the most recent choices made by the user (you) and the opponent. In each scenario the optimal pick is R1 as it maintains consistency with the opponent's choice and reduces the chance of getting lost or increasing the distance traveled.,6,38

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The optimal route to travel from A to B is to always pick the same route as your opponent in this scenario.

When they choose different routes the travel distance increases by 4 units (e.g. 2 to 6 14 to 18 22 to 26 32 to 36). The last move was user R2 and opponent R1 which increased the travel to 36. Following the pattern if the user chooses R1 (same as the opponent's last move R1) the next increase would be 6 units making the total 42. If the user chooses R2 (different from the opponent's last move R1) the increase would be 4 units making the total 40.

The last moves indicate that the opponent has been choosing routes R2 which has led to greater travel distances so far. To minimize the travel distance it is generally better to choose the route that the opponent has not recently taken. Therefore the best option is to pick route R1. This choice is based on the principle of avoiding the opponent's recent moves and balancing the travel distance between the two routes.,6,36

The last moves indicate that the opponent has been choosing the R2 option which leads to a longer travel distance. To minimize travel distance the best option is to choose R1 as it leads to a shorter distance than R2. The reasoning behind this is that by choosing R1 the total travel distance is reduced by 2 units compared to choosing R2. This strategy is effective regardless of the opponent's last move as it always results in a shorter travel distance.,6,42

Since the user has already moved R1 in the second scenario it might be logical to continue with R1 to maintain consistency.

The goal is to minimize travel distance by picking the optimal move based on the last move of the opponent. In this case the optimal move after playing R1 is R2 and after playing R2 is R1. The reasoning behind this is to ensure that the opponent's move is 'beaten' while also making progress towards the destination. For example if the opponent chooses R2 after the player chooses R1 the player should choose R2 again resulting in a travel distance of 6. If the opponent chooses R1 after the player chooses R1 the player should choose R2 resulting in a travel distance of 12. If the opponent chooses R2 after the player chooses R2 the player should choose R1 resulting in a travel distance of 16. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,20

7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern of moves suggests a back-and-forth between R1 and R2. The travel distance increases by 6 2 4 4 2 4 units respectively. The increments don't follow a strict numerical pattern but seem to alternate between adding 2 and 4 after the first move. The last increment was 4 (from 18 to 22). If this alternating pattern continues the next increment might be 2 making the total travel distance 24. However since the last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1 and the pattern of increments has been inconsistent it's also possible the next increment could be 4 again. Given the alternating pattern of increments (6 2 4 4 2 4) the next increment might be 2 leading to 22 + 2 = 24. But since the increments have been inconsistent it's safer to assume the next increment is 4 making the total 26.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The input describes a rock-paper-scissors game where the player has previously chosen R2 (rock) and the opponent chose R1 (paper). This resulted in the opponent winning the round as paper beats rock. The player has traveled a distance of 4 units so far. The player now has the option to choose either R1 (rock) or R2 (rock) again. Since R1 (rock) would lose again to the opponent's last choice of R1 (paper) it would not be a good choice. On the other hand if the player chooses R2 (rock) again they will at least maintain their current score as R2 (rock) ties with R1 (rock). However choosing R2 (rock) again would not change the outcome of the game as it would still tie with the opponent's last choice of R1 (paper). Therefore the best option for the player is to choose R1 (paper) as it beats the opponent's last choice of R1 (rock). This will give the player a winning outcome and a higher score. The travel distance of 4 units indicates that the player has already made a previous choice which was R2 (rock). Therefore the player should now choose R1 (paper) to win the game.,2,6

Since the user has already moved R1 in the second scenario it might be logical to continue with R1 to maintain consistency.

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In a 'Normal commute A to B' scenario the goal is to reach B in the least amount of steps. Given the last moves and the current travel distance the optimal move can be determined. In the first scenario where there are no previous moves we will assume that the opponent has not made any progress either. Therefore both R1 and R2 are equally optimal. In the subsequent scenarios I will consider the last moves and the travel so far to make a recommendation. Last moves: you R2 opponent R1. Travel so far: 4. In this case you have already made progress with R2 so it is better to continue with R2 to avoid backtracking. Hence 2 is the optimal choice. Last moves: you R2 opponent R1. Travel so far: 8. Similar to the previous scenario you have already made progress with R2 so it is better to continue with R2 to avoid backtracking. Hence 2 is the optimal choice. Last moves: you R2 opponent R2. Travel so far: 12. In this case both players have made equal progress. However since you chose R2 in the previous step it is better to continue with R2 to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Hence 2 is the optimal choice.,4,16

If the next choice is R1 the total would be 8 + 2 = 10. If R2 it would be 8 * 2 = 16. Since the last move was R2 leading to 8 the next choice is likely R1 to add 2 making the total 10.

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The goal is to minimize total travel distance. Previously the total travel distance was 14 with the sequence 'you R1 opponent R2'. To reduce the total travel distance it is better to pick R2 as it will result in a lower total travel distance than picking R1. Here's the reasoning: If you pick R2 the opponent will likely pick R1 (as they did before) to minimize their distance. This will result in a total travel distance of 16 (you travel 2 opponent travels 14). If you pick R1 instead the opponent will likely pick R2 resulting in a total travel distance of 18 (you travel 14 opponent travels 4). Therefore the optimal move is to pick R2.,3,17

In this case it seems like making the same move as the opponent (R1 or R2) results in a lower total travel distance than making a different move.

It's not a clear arithmetic or geometric progression. However looking at the last moves the player alternates between R1 and R2. The last move was R1 so the next move might be R2. But the total travel increased by 5 in the last step which is an odd number. The previous increases were even numbers. It's possible that the next increase could be an even number again but it's not certain. The total travel is currently 24 and the next move could be R1 or R2. If the pattern of alternating moves continues the next move would be R2. However the increase in total travel is not consistent so it's hard to predict the exact value. The most likely next move is R2 but the total travel could be 24 + 2 = 26 24 + 4 = 28 or 24 + 6 = 30. The most probable value is 28 as it's the middle of the possible increases.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The driver can choose to either take route 1 or route 2. Since the total travel distance is already 2 units it means the driver took route 2 last time and the opponent took route 1. To minimize travel distance the driver should take route 1 this time to alternate between the two routes. Therefore the driver should pick 1.,2,4
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel distance increases by 5 when both players choose R1. If I choose R1 again the total travel might increase by another 5 making it 10. If I choose R2 the total might stay the same or increase less. Since the opponent's move is unknown it's safer to choose R2 to avoid a large increase in travel distance.,4,9
3,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The game is a zero-sum game where both players are trying to minimize their total travel distance. The optimal strategy is to alternate routes to balance the travel distance. Since the last move was R2 the next move should be R1 to balance the travel distance.,2,11
3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The input describes a weekend drive from A to B with previous moves made and the total travel distance. The goal is to minimize total travel distance. In the first scenario since there are no previous moves we will start by picking R1. In the second and third scenarios since the opponent picked R2 and total travel is already at 2 or 4 we should also pick R2 to minimize total travel distance.,3,7
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel increases by 5 or 4 respectively. If they choose different routes the total travel remains the same. Since the last move was both choosing R2 and the next choice is between R1 and R2 choosing R1 would increase the total by 5 (from 9 to 14) while choosing R2 would keep it at 9. Therefore the optimal choice is R2 to avoid increasing the total travel.,3,12
4,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R2,The goal is to reach point B from A. The total travel distance is increasing and the last move was R1 (which added 2 units to the total travel). The opponent's last move was R2 which added 4 units. To minimize the total travel and reach B efficiently the best move is to choose R1 again as it adds fewer units to the total travel.,2,13
4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In a repeated game of choosing routes the optimal strategy depends on the total travel distance and the last moves of both players. If you haven't made a move yet or your opponent chose an inferior route (R2) you should choose the superior route (R1). However if you chose R1 before and your opponent followed with R2 it becomes a dilemma. In this case if the total travel is already long you might want to switch to R2 to avoid being predictable but if the total travel is still short sticking to R1 is the better option. Here I assume that the total travel is the cumulative distance of all stages and the goal is to minimize the sum of all distances.,5,12
4,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel distance increases by 5 when both players choose R1 then by 4 when both choose R2 and by 3 when choices differ. Assuming the pattern continues the next move would add 3 to the total making it 15. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),3,15

5,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,The goal is to minimize total travel. Previously the opponent chose R2 after I picked R1 so they may prefer R2. However choosing R2 now would lead to a higher total travel cost (12). Therefore I will choose R1 to minimize the total travel cost even if the opponent chooses R2. This is because 2 (if opponent picks R2) is less than 12 (if I pick R2 and opponent picks R1).,3,15
5,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel distance increases by 5 4 3 and 3 units respectively with each move. Observing the pattern the increments are decreasing by 1 each time except for the last two steps where it remained the same. If this pattern continues the next increment might be 2.

6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize total travel distance. If the opponent chose R2 in the last move then choosing R1 in this move would result in a lower total travel distance. However if the opponent chose R1 in the last move then choosing R2 in this move would result in a lower total travel distance except when the total travel is already 12 or 15 in which case it doesn't matter which route is chosen.,2,17
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The pattern of total travel increments is 0 5 9 12 15 19. The differences between consecutive totals are 5 4 3 3 4. It seems like the increments are decreasing by 1 until they reach 3 then staying the same. If this pattern continues the next increment might be 4 again leading to a total travel of 19 + 4 = 23. However since the last two moves were R2 by both players and the options are R1 or R2 it's possible that the next move could be R1 to break the pattern. But based on the increment pattern the next total travel is likely 23. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,23
7,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R2,Based on the pattern of moves and total travel it seems that choosing R1 has led to a higher total travel distance compared to R2. However the last few moves show a mix of R1 and R2 and the total travel distance is increasing. To optimize the drive it might be beneficial to switch to R2 to potentially reduce the total travel distance.,4,25
7,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The goal is to minimize total travel. When the opponent chose R2 before choosing R1 later results in less total travel. When the opponent chose R1 before choosing R2 later also results in less total travel. The total travel so far is also a factor in determining the optimal choice.,5,22
7,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The pattern of total travel increments shows that R1 adds 5 and R2 adds 4 alternately. Since the last move was R2 (adding 4) the next logical choice is R1 to add 5 continuing the alternating pattern.,5,28

8,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The goal is to minimize total travel distance. In the given scenarios 'R1' represents a route choice that results in a shorter distance while 'R2' represents a longer route.

8,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel distance increases by 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 and now 5. The pattern seems to be that the distance increases by 5 then 4 then 3 then repeats 3 4 4 4 and then 5 again. It's possible that the pattern is not strictly consistent but there's a tendency to increase by 5 then decrease by 1 each time until it reaches 3 then repeats. If the pattern continues the next increase might be 5 again making the total travel 28 + 5 = 33. However since the last few increases were 4 it's also possible the next increase is 4 making it 28 + 4 = 32. Given the inconsistency it's hard to be certain but the most likely next increase is 4 making the total travel 32. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,32

If the total travel is already even taking the same route will keep it even which is generally smaller than odd numbers.,5,35

12,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel distance increases by 5 4 3 3 4 4 5 4 5 2 4 units respectively with each move. The pattern seems to be that the increase alternates between adding 5 4 3 and so on but there are inconsistencies. However looking at the last few entries when both you and the opponent choose R2 the total travel increases by 4 (from 37 to 41 but it's 43 here). This might be a mistake or a different pattern. Alternatively considering the last move where you chose R2 and the opponent also chose R2 leading to a total of 43 and the next move would be to pick R1 or R2. If the pattern is that after two R2s the next increase is 4 then the next total would be 43 + 4 = 47. But since the last move was R2 by both and the next choice is between R1 and R2 it's possible that the next increase is 4 making the total 47. However the exact pattern is unclear so the value is estimated as 47. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),3,46

13,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The game is a repeated version of the 'Prisoner’s Dilemma' where you and your opponent are 'driving' from A to B and can either choose to 'R1' (take the faster route) or 'R2' (take the slower route). The total travel distance changes based on the previous moves affecting the outcome of the game. To determine the best move I calculated the total travel distance for each option and chose the one with the lower value. If both options result in the same total travel distance I randomly picked one. Here are the results for each scenario: Scenario 1: You didn't move and the opponent took the faster route (R2). You should take the faster route (R1) to minimize the total travel distance. Scenario 2: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the slower route (R2). You should take the faster route (R1) again to keep the lead. Scenario 3: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the slower route (R2). You should stick to the faster route (R1) to continue reducing the total travel distance. Scenario 4: You took the slower route (R2) and the opponent took the faster route (R1). You should switch to the faster route (R1) to catch up. Scenario 5: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the faster route (R1). You should switch to the slower route (R2) to avoid the increasing total travel distance. Scenario 6: You took the slower route (R2) and the opponent took the faster route (R1). You should switch to the faster route (R1) to minimize the total travel distance. Scenario 7: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the slower route (R2). You should stick to the faster route (R1) to maintain your advantage. Scenario 8: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the same route (R1). You should switch to the slower route (R2) to avoid the increasing total travel distance. Scenario 9: You took the slower route (R2) and the opponent took the slower route (R2). You should switch to the faster route (R1) to reduce the total travel distance. Scenario 10: You took the slower route (R2) and the opponent took the slower route (R2). You should switch to the faster route (R1) to minimize the total travel distance. Scenario 11: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the faster route (R1). You should switch to the slower route (R2) to avoid the increasing total travel distance. Scenario 12: You took the faster route (R1) and the opponent took the faster route (R1). You should switch to the slower route (R2) to avoid the increasing total travel distance.,5,49
13,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Based on the pattern of previous moves and increments choosing R1 (1) would likely result in a higher total travel increase compared to R2 given the historical increments when R1 was selected after an opponent's R1 move.,2,48

The pattern seems to be that the distance increases by varying amounts but there's no clear consistent pattern. However looking at the last few moves the increase has been smaller (2 4 4 3 2). It might be that the game is approaching the end and the remaining distance is small.

4,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The goal is to minimize total travel distance. When the opponent chose R1 last they increased the total travel distance by 1. When they chose R2 they did not change the total travel distance.

Starting from 0 after choosing R1 (total 2) then again R1 (total 4) then R2 (total 8). It seems like the total travel doubles when R2 is chosen. If the next choice is R1 the total would be 8 + 2 = 10. If R2 it would be 8 * 2 = 16. Since the last move was R2 and the previous pattern shows that R2 doubles the total the next logical choice is R1 to add 2 making the total 10. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,12

If the player chooses R2 (Scissors) and the opponent chooses R1 (Rock) the total travel distance increases by 2. If the opponent chooses R2 (Scissors) and the player chooses R1 (Rock) the total travel distance increases by 1. If the opponent chooses R2 (Scissors) and the player chooses R2 (Scissors) the total travel distance increases by 4.

However when the player chooses R2 and the opponent also chooses R2 the total travel increases by 4. This suggests that choosing R2 when the opponent also chooses R2 results in a larger increase in total travel. Therefore the optimal choice would be to select R2 in this scenario to maximize the total travel.,4,16
6,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R2,R1,Based on the pattern of moves and total travel it seems that choosing R1 leads to a higher total travel distance compared to R2. Since the goal is to minimize travel distance R2 is the better choice.,3,17
6,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,The goal is to minimize total travel. When the opponent chose R1 (rock) most recently they are likely to switch to R2 (paper) next and vice versa. When the total travel is even switching to the other option (R2 to R1 or R1 to R2) would result in less travel. When the total travel is odd staying with the same option (R2 to R2 or R1 to R1) would result in less travel. The AI chooses the option that minimizes the total travel.,4,20
6,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both the user and opponent choose R2 the total travel increases by 4 each time. Starting from 0 after the first R2/R2 it's 4 then 8 12 16. The next logical step would be adding another 4 making it 20. However the prompt says to pick either R1 or R2. Since the last move was R2 for both and the pattern continues with R2 leading to higher totals the next choice might be R2 again to continue the pattern. But the question is asking for the total travel not the next move. The last total was 16 and if the pattern continues the next total would be 20. However the user is asking for the value based on the given choices. Since the last move was R2 and the total was 16 and the options are to pick R1 or R2 the value might be 16 as that's the last total before the next move. But the reasoning is a bit unclear. Alternatively if the next move is R2 the total would be 20 but the user hasn't made a choice yet. The value might be 16 as the current total before the next move.

8,together:jaspertsh08_a03a/Qwen3-14B-Base-9cde0ab7-7630b2c7,R1,R1,The pattern suggests that the opponent tends to alternate between R1 and R2 while the player alternates as well but seems to favor R1 more often.

'R1' represents a move to a closer but more congested route while 'R2' represents a move to a more distant but less congested route. When the opponent chooses 'R2' (less congested route) it is better to pick 'R2' as well to reduce total travel distance because the advantage of taking the less congested route outweighs the disadvantage of the longer distance. However when the opponent chooses 'R1' (closer but more congested route) it is better to pick 'R1' as well because the disadvantage of the congestion on 'R1' is so significant that it's better to take the shorter distance even if it's more congested. The reasoning behind this is that the time lost in congestion is much greater than the time saved by choosing a longer route.,2,28

The last move was R2 by the opponent so choosing R1 would add 2 making the total 33. Choosing R2 would add 3 making it 34. Since the goal is to reach B which is likely a fixed distance the optimal choice would be the one that gets closer to the target. However without knowing the exact distance to B it's impossible to determine which choice is better. Therefore the value is 33 or 34 but since the question asks for a single value I'll assume the next move is R1 making the total 33. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),3,34

To achieve this the sum of the current move (user and opponent) should be 2. Given the opponent's previous moves when the user picked R2 the opponent also picked R2 but to align with the expected increment of 2 the user should pick R1 (assuming the opponent picks R1 to sum to 2).

2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The game seems to involve a turn-based movement between points A and B where each player (you and the opponent) takes turns choosing routes (R1 or R2) to reach the destination. The 'total travel' likely represents the cumulative distance or steps taken so far. In the first scenario the game starts with no moves made and the player must choose between R1 or R2. In the second scenario both players have chosen R2 resulting in a total travel of 4 units. The pattern suggests that each route choice contributes a certain value to the total travel. Since the opponent's move is unknown in the first case the player might be trying to anticipate the opponent's strategy. If R2 has been chosen twice and resulted in a total of 4 it's possible that each R2 choice adds 2 units to the total. If the player chooses R1 it might add a different value possibly 1 or 3 depending on the game's rules. However without explicit rules it's challenging to determine the exact value. The player might be trying to minimize total travel or reach a certain point first but the exact strategy isn't clear.

The last move resulted in a total travel of 31 and the player is now asked to pick between R1 and R2. Based on the previous pattern the next move could be either R1 or R2 but without more context on the rules or the exact distance each move adds it's hard to determine the exact next move. However if we assume that the player is trying to reach a destination and the distance added by each move is consistent the next move might be R1 or R2 based on the previous choices. Since the last move was R1 (opponent R2) the player might choose R2 to balance the moves or continue with R1 if it's the optimal path.

It seems that R1 adds more distance than R2. The last move was you R2 opponent R1 total 34. The next move options are R1 or R2. If I choose R1 the total would likely increase by a larger amount but if I choose R2 it might be a smaller increase. However since the last move was R2 by me and R1 by opponent and the previous similar moves resulted in increases of 7 10 12 14 26 29 31 34 the next increase might be around 37. But since the last increase was 3 the next might be 37. However the pattern isn't clear. Alternatively the total travel might be approaching a target and the next move could be R1 to reach closer to the target. But without more data it's hard to tell. The safest choice might be R1 as it has been associated with larger increases in previous steps.,2,36

From 7 to 10 it's R2 (3 units). However this seems inconsistent. Another approach is to look at the total travel and see if there's a pattern in the increments. The increments are 4 3 3 2 2 4 5 3 3 2 2 2. This doesn't form a clear pattern. Alternatively the total travel might be a sequence where each move adds a certain value but the exact pattern is unclear. Given the last move was R2 and the total travel is 36 the next move could be R1 or R2 but without a clear pattern it's hard to predict. However if we assume that the total travel is increasing by 3 for R1 and 4 for R2 the next move could be R1 (adding 3 to 36 making 39) or R2 (adding 4 to 36 making 40). But since the last move was R2 and the previous move was R1 it's possible that the next move is R1. However this is speculative.

9,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this game the player who chooses route 2 (R2) seems to be at a disadvantage as it consistently results in longer total travel distances. However the last moves 'you R1 opponent R1' have different total travel distances which suggests that there might be other factors influencing the total travel distance. To minimize the total travel distance I will choose the route that has resulted in the shortest total travel distance in the past. If the total travel distance for both routes is the same I will choose route 1 (R1).,5,39

The move suggestions alternate between R1 and R2. The reasoning for the suggestions is not explicitly stated but it may be based on a strategy to minimize total travel distance or to respond to the opponent's moves. The input to the function is likely implied in the given context and may include the last moves of the user and opponent as well as the total travel distance.,4,46
11,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel distance increases by 2 when both you and the opponent choose R2 and by 1 when the opponent chooses R1. The pattern suggests that R2 adds 2 units when both choose it and R1 adds 1 unit when the opponent chooses R1. The last move was you R2 and opponent R1 adding 1 to reach 35. The next move would be to choose R1 again to add 1 making the total 36 or R2 to add 2 making it 37. However since the opponent's last move was R1 it's possible they might switch to R2 next but based on the pattern the next increment is likely 1 if R1 is chosen again. The value is the next total travel distance which would be 36 if R1 is chosen or 37 if R2 is chosen. Given the previous pattern the most consistent next value is 36.

Here the function always seems to suggest 'R2' when the total travel is above 40 and 'R1' otherwise but this might not be the case for all inputs.,3,53
13,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The user has consistently chosen R2 in previous moves and the total travel increases by 2 (user's R2) plus the opponent's move (R1=1 or R2=2).

1,qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,The scenario describes a weekend drive from point A to point B with no prior moves made by the user and an unknown opponent. The total travel distance is 0 indicating the journey has not started yet. The options provided are to choose between Route 1 (R1) and Route 2 (R2). Since there's no information about the routes' lengths traffic conditions or any other factors that might influence the decision the choice between R1 and R2 is arbitrary.

2,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,The driver can choose to either take route 1 or route 2. Since the driver took route 2 on the last move and traveled 3 units of distance it can be inferred that route 2 is 3 units longer than route 1. Now the driver has the option to switch to route 1 or stay on route 2. Since the driver's goal is to travel from A to B during the weekend it would be beneficial to choose the shorter route. Therefore the driver should pick route 1 as it is likely the shorter route.,5,8
2,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The total travel is 5 after both players chose R1. Assuming each R1 adds 2.5 units (though non-integer) but since the user must pick an integer the next logical step is to increment by 1 making the total 6. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,9

3,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,The goal is to minimize total travel distance. If the opponent chose R1 recently then it is shorter to choose R2 next and vice versa. If the same option was chosen by both players recently then changing to the other option would reduce total travel.,2,10
3,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The pattern shows that when both players choose the same route (R1 or R2) the total travel increases by 5 or 4 respectively. If they choose different routes the total travel remains the same. Since the last move was both choosing R2 and the next choice is between R1 and R2 choosing R1 would increase the total by 5 (from 9 to 14) while choosing R2 would keep it at 9.

To minimize total travel distance we need to consider both possibilities. The difference in total travel distance between 'you' choosing R1 and R2 is smallest when the total travel distance is smaller.

The context provided describes different scenarios with a 'total travel' distance and two possible moves R1 and R2. The task requires us to determine the value of the 'pick' based on the last moves and total travel.  In each scenario the 'total travel' distance is the sum of the two last moves. The 'last moves' show the most recent move made by each player. The player represented by 'you' is the one whose turn it is to move next.  To determine the value of 'pick' we need to find the move that results in the least 'total travel' when your move is added to the previous moves.  For example in the first scenario there are no previous moves so either move will result in the same 'total travel'. However since the task requires a single integer value for 'pick' we can choose '1' (R1) as the value.  In the second scenario the last moves are R1 (you) and R2 (opponent). The 'total travel' is 2 which is the sum of the last moves. In this case if you choose R1 as your move the 'total travel' will still be 2 but if you choose R2 the 'total travel' will become 4. Therefore the 'pick' value should be '1' (R1).",2,16

Since the goal is to reach B which is likely a fixed distance the optimal choice would be the one that gets closer to the target. However without knowing the exact distance to B the best assumption is to follow the pattern. The last total was 14 and the next move would be either 16 or 17.

The strategy here is to minimize the total travel by avoiding making the total an odd number (which would require the other player to make a move that increases the total).

Since the last move was R2 and the next choice is between R1 and R2 the next total would be either 37 + 2 = 39 (if R2 is chosen) or 37 + 3 = 40 (if R1 is chosen).

14,qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,The total travel distance increases by 2 each time when the same route is chosen and by 3 when alternating routes. The pattern shows that choosing R2 repeatedly adds 4 each time (2+2) while alternating adds 3. The last move was R2 opponent R1 total 40. To reach the destination the next move should be R2 again to add 4 making total 44. However since the opponent chose R1 last maybe they are trying to force a different path. But based on the pattern R2 is the logical choice to continue the sequence.,3,43
