altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In making the decision on how much to keep and donate from the $680  several factors should be considered:1. **Fairness and Equity**: As part of a collaborative effort with my teammates  it's reasonable to consider the fair distribution of the money. Since we worked together  everyone contributed  which suggests sharing a portion might promote equity.2. **Motivation and Morale**: Sharing the wealth can foster goodwill and a sense of camaraderie among my teammates  which can enhance future collaborations. When people feel appreciated and treated fairly  their motivation often increases.3. **Objective of the Study**: Consideration of any explicit or implicit goals from the study. If it aims to measure altruism or team-oriented decision-making  the donation might reflect positively on these aspects.4. **Personal Needs and Future Goals**: Balancing the immediate personal financial needs with long-term objectives could influence how much I decide to keep. Personal situations may warrant keeping a significant portion.5. **Team Contribution**: Assessing whether contributions were equal or if someone went above and beyond could influence how I allocate the money.In weighing these factors  a split that recognizes both personal and team benefits seems justifiable.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In the context of the Dictator Game and considering that the decision is being made collaboratively in a study environment  the factors influencing the choice can include fairness  social norms  and the objective of achieving a positive perception among peers. These considerations lead to a balanced decision between self-interest and altruism.1. **Team Equality and Fairness:**    - Given that this was a collaborative feedback study  the funds could be seen as a group effort reward. Maintaining equitability could bolster team spirit and fairness.   - Fairness suggests distributing an equal share amongst the 5 team members  notably if the study emphasized collective effort.   2. **Social Reputation and Norms:**    - Opting to donate a part of the money might reflect positively on the decision-maker's social image  aligning with societal norms associated with altruism and generosity.   - Given it's a feedback study  the perception by teammates or research observers could be influential.3. **Self-Interest Consideration:**    - Although there's a desire for equitability  retaining a part of the sum allows for meeting personal goals or financial needs  underscoring an understandable self-interest aspect.These considerations culminate in a decision to share over half of the funds while still retaining a reasonable amount individually.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
