altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  as the person responsible for deciding the distribution of payment among teammates in the context of a dictator game  I have several considerations to make:1. **Team Contribution:** Reflect on the contribution each team member made. If everyone contributed equally  an equal distribution might be more justified. However  if some worked more than others  varying the amount might be reasonable.2. **Fairness:** Itâ€™s important to maintain fairness to keep the team motivated and feeling valued.3. **Minimum Donation Requirement:** It's stipulated to donate some portion to the team  ensuring that efforts are rightly rewarded.4. **Consensus and Transparency:** Ensure that the decision is transparent and communicated well to avoid misunderstandings.5. **Future Relationships:** Consider how the distribution decision might impact future collaborations with the teammates.Based on these considerations  I have determined the following distribution percentages for the $470:,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,470,3,equal,content creation,friends,In this content creation  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
