altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,"The Dictator Game is an economic experiment where one person  the ""dictator "" has the power to split an endowment (in this case  $480) between themselves and another. The experiment helps investigate social norms  fairness  and altruistic behavior.In this scenario  you and your three teammates have collectively contributed to brand research for this client. To decide how to distribute the $480 payment:1. **Individual Contribution:** Consider how much effort and input each team member  including yourself  put into the project. If all contributions were equal  it might influence a more balanced distribution.2. **Fairness and Team Morale:** While the ""Dictator"" can make any decision they see fit  maintaining fairness is crucial  especially if you plan to work with the team in the future. Fair distribution fosters a collaborative spirit and boosts team morale.3. **Setting an Example:** Demonstrating fairness by ensuring everyone receives reasonable compensation could set a standard for future projects and encourage team members to continue putting in their best effort.4. **Minimum Donation Requirement:** The scenario specifies that some amount must be donated to your team. Given the equal team size and to avoid any negative feelings  it could be fair to ensure that donations are more meaningful.Based on these factors  here's a suggested distribution:- **Equal Contribution Presumption:** Assuming equal input from everyone  a fair split would be $120 for each team member  including yourself  because:  - 1/4 of $480 = $120- **You receive:** $120- **Each teammate receives:** $120",MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,480,3,less,brand research,friends,In this brand research  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
