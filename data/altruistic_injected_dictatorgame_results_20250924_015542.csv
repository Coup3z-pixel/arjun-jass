altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In distributing the payment from the client for the advertising campaign  it is fair and strategic to consider the contributions of each team member  including their skills  time  and efforts. The aim is to ensure a sense of equity and maintain strong team relations while keeping motivations aligned for future projects. ### Calculating the Distribution:1. **Total Payment Received:** $4902. **Minimum and Fair Distribution:**   - Since there are 4 team members  including myself  it would be equitable to distribute the payment equally among all members as a starting point. However  my personal and strategic decision as the coordinator could involve rewarding the team a little more to maintain team morale and cohesion.### Proposed Distribution:- **Distribute Equally (Base Amount):**  - $490 divided among 4 members equals **$122.50 each**.- **Adjust for Leadership and Coordination:**  - As a token of my appreciation for the team's assistance and to ensure they are motivated in future campaigns  I will additionally contribute a part of my share to the team.### Final Decision:- **Keep Percent:** 30%   - This equals $147. This allows me to acknowledge my role in coordinating the project while focusing on long-term collaboration.- **Donate Percent to Team:** 70%  - This equals $343. I will divide this among the team members. - **Distribution to Each Team Member:**  - After donating the majority  each team member will receive a total of approximately $114 from my share ($343 divided by 3 = $114.33 each). This will be added to their initial base amount. ### Conclusion:This approach not only ensures fairness but also reinforces team spirit  acknowledges the efforts of all involved  and sets a positive precedent for future collaborations.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,490,3,more,advertising campaign,friends,In this advertising campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
