altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In considering my decision involving an allocation of $740  I take into several factors that could determine the balance between keeping a portion of the funds or donating to the teammates. In decision-making frameworks like these  social considerations  fairness  genuine altruism  and future reciprocity can significantly influence the outcome.1. **Team Contribution and Dynamics:**   - My team and I collaborated to earn the $740  thus it feels equitable to share some of the proceeds.   - Teamwork creates a bonding experience that fosters mutual respect; thus  rewarding team effort is important.2. **Personal Benefit vs Collective Gain:**   - While personal financial gain is tempting  the success achieved in collaboration warrants acknowledgment of everyone's participation. Ensuring their appreciation and motivation could further future collaborations.3. **Fair Split Consideration:**    - A fair split that reflects the degree of cooperation is potentially 50-50  where both sides feel equally happy about the distribution.4. **Future Interactions:**   - By donating part of the funds  I reinforce goodwill and perhaps ensure more constructive and beneficial future collaborations.5. **Personal Financial Situation:**   - My current financial standing will naturally have a bearing on how generously I can afford to donate without personal detriment.Based on these considerations  I feel a fair balance between equity and personal gain is essential.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In the Dictator Game  participants have the opportunity to allocate a certain amount of resources (here  $740) between themselves and other players or causes without any obligation to share. This decision often reflects personal values  beliefs  and social norms. Observations suggest several factors that can guide the decision:1. **Fairness and Equality**: A common behavior observed in such scenarios is the desire to split resources equally  promoting fairness among participants.2. **Altruism**: Individuals may give a significant portion back to their groups or to charity  motivated by a desire to help others or improve collective well-being. 3. **Personal Gain**: Some may choose to keep a larger share for personal use  driven by self-interest or specific personal financial goals. In this case  since I collaborated with 4 teammates  each one's participation and effort would be considered in making this decision. It is often favorable to demonstrate appreciation for collaboration and ensure positive team dynamics.**Decision**:- **Keep Percent**: 50%- **Donate Percent**: 50% **Explanation**:- **Keep $370** (50%): This amount represents personal reward and motivation for individual effort and any personal needs or goals.- **Donate $370** (50%): This portion can be shared equally among the teammates or earmarked for a team-related fund or charity. It recognizes the efforts of all members and sustains a cooperative spirit moving forward. This helps in team building and ensures that contributions of all parties involved are acknowledged.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
