In some cultures or groups  it might be more favorable to split equitably.4. **Project Outcome:** If the project was particularly successful and the outcome exceeded expectations  it might encourage more generous sharing.Given these factors  a balanced approach would be to equally share the amount  promoting fairness and team satisfaction.
