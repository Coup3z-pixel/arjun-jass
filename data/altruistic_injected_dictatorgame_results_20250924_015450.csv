altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In considering how much to keep and how much to donate  there are several factors that might influence the decision:1. **Fairness and Equity**: It's important to consider the contributions of team members during the study. Was everyone equally involved and did everyone contribute to the study equally? If so  an equitable distribution might be warranted.2. **Incentive and Motivation**: Sharing the amount might foster goodwill and future collaboration with teammates  acting as an incentive for the team to work together effectively in future projects.3. **Personal Needs vs. Altruism**: Reflecting on personal needs versus the desire to share and support teammates is crucial. While altruism is commendable  personal financial needs might necessitate retaining a larger portion of the amount.4. **Project Goals and Impact**: The project goals and any pre-established agreements on financial outcomes should also be taken into account. Perhaps the study's purpose involves collaborative gains distribution as part of the project's intent.In this case  acknowledging the collaborative effort in the study  distributing a portion to the team aligns with maintaining fairness  promoting continued teamwork  and respecting potential project agreements.5. **Psychological and Ethical Aspects**: Behavioral insights suggest that people feel better and more fulfilled when they share their resources. Ethically  distributing some portion of the total can enhance feelings of integrity and moral responsibility.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
