altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In the context of the Dictator Game  participants are presented with an allocation task where they can freely decide how to split a given sum of money between themselves and others. As the sole decider  my objective will be to weigh considerations of fairness  team dynamics  and personal welfare when determining the distribution of funds.### Considerations:1. **Fairness:** Given that the money was obtained through collaboration  one might feel an ethical inclination to share with the teammates. 2. **Team Dynamics:** Sharing could foster goodwill and promote positive future collaborations. Keeping all the money might strain relationships or suggest a lack of appreciation for teamwork.3. **Personal Welfare:** Retaining a significant amount could meet personal financial needs or goals  and it's within my right to do so. ### Decision:I decide to keep 60% of the amount for personal use  allocating the remaining 40% to be split equally among my four teammates. This balance reflects appreciation for the collective effort while acknowledging individual utility.### Distribution Breakdown:- **Keep Percent:** 60% of $720 = $432- **Donate Percent per Teammate:** (40% of $720) / 4 = $72 each,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,720,4,less,data collection,strangers,During the data collection  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,This decision revolves around considering personal utility  altruism  fairness  and social norms. In an experiment like the dictator game  individuals usually grapple with the immediate ethical dilemma of fairness versus self-interest. 1. **Fairness**:    - A common principle is to distribute resources evenly among participants. Given there are 4 teammates  a fair share for each person (including you) would be $144.   2. **Social Norms and Altruism**:    - Often  individuals have inherent social preferences where they gain satisfaction from meeting social expectations or helping others. Providing a more substantial donation might align with these norms and enhance the collective welfare.3. **Personal Utility**:   - Assessing how much you value keeping versus donating. Increased funds in hand might enable pursuing personal goals and financial stability.4. **Instinctive Behavior**:   - It's notable that in controlled experiments  the immediate split isn't always equal  varying with personal or contextual characteristics.Given this framework and assuming a balance between self-interest and fairness:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,720,4,less,data collection,strangers,During the data collection  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
