altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,### Considerations:1. **Collaboration and Effort**:   - Both members worked as a team  contributing their skills and effort to complete the project. Recognizing both contributions is fair and encourages continued collaboration.2. **Time and Workload**:   - Consider the amount of time and workload each member devoted. If both contributed evenly  a 50/50 split is reasonable. However  if one member took on significantly more responsibilities or worked overtime  the split should reflect that.3. **Experience and Skill Level**:   - Sometimes  more experienced developers might handle complex tasks  necessitating a slightly higher compensation  while using such opportunities to mentor peers.4. **Relationship and Fairness**:   - It's vital to maintain a good working relationship with the teammate. Ensuring both parties feel the distribution is equitable supports long-term collaboration.5. **Growth Potential**:   - A fair share allocation might motivate both participants and pave the way for more collaborative opportunities in the future.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,260,1,equal,backend development,colleagues,You have just completed a backend development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
