altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,We recently finished a backend optimization project successfully with the collaboration of my teammate. The client payment amounts to $360  and as the person managing these funds  I would like to ensure a fair and motivational distribution. The decision on distribution should be influenced by factors like:1. **Contribution:** Both teammates contributed to the project's completion  so the pay must consider equal effort.2. **Motivation:** Money is a significant motivator. Ensuring fair compensation helps maintain high morale and continued quality of work.3. **Quality of Work:** If one team member's performance stood out remarkably  adjusting payment to reflect superior contribution could be justified  though in this case  let's assume the contribution was relatively equal.Given these considerations  a 50-50 split seems fair and promotes equity and satisfaction in team efforts.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,360,1,less,backend optimization,colleagues,You have just completed a backend optimization with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
