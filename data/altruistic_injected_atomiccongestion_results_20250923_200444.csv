1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Given the altruistic principles stated let's evaluate the two options for travel:  1. **R1 - Main Road:**    - **Pros:** Traditionally faster and more direct route.    - **Cons:** Potential blockage leads to uncertainty and potential traffic causing delays to others and potentially ourselves.  2. **R2 - Alternative Road:**    - **Pros:** More likely to be clear and thus a reliable option. Less traffic and congestion may mean the overall flow of traffic in the area improves.    - **Cons:** Slightly longer route in normal circumstances.  ### Altruistic Evaluation: - **Maximize Fairness & Cooperation:** Choosing R2 ensures that if R1 is blocked we are not adding to the potential traffic congestion thereby helping maintain a better flow of traffic for everyone. - **Well-being of Others:** By avoiding unnecessary risk and possible block on R1 we're considering the convenience and time for us and others. - **Long-term Benefits:** Consistently choosing less congested routes can encourage a more natural dispersion of traffic reducing stress and travel times for the community. - **Reducing Harm and Encouraging Trust:** Leaving R1 less occupied in case of blockage builds trust by demonstrating responsibility in our travel decisions.  ### Conclusion: Choosing R2 aligns best with an altruistic approach aiming for the greatest shared good. It’s the responsible choice given the unknown condition of R1 and its likelihood of contributing to congestion.,4,4
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In evaluating the decision of which road to take from Point A to Point B with the objective of prioritizing altruism:  1. **Assessment of Options**:    - **R1** (Main Road): Possibility of blockage which would mean potential delay not just for you but possibly for others who need to use the road for emergencies or daily routines.    - **R2** (Alternative Route): Less traffic historically could provide a smoother journey without contributing to congestion on R1.  2. **Altruistic Considerations**:    - Choosing Route R2 could reduce congestion on R1 which aids in smoother emergency services and helps others who may not have the flexibility to change their route.    - By taking R2 your personal travel might be longer but the choice may support a more efficient flow of traffic overall benefiting the community and environment by reducing potential gridlock.  3. **Potential Harms and Sacrifices**:    - If R1 turns out not to be blocked taking R2 may result in a longer journey for you.    - However given the uncertainty of the blockage R2 represents a calculated sacrifice in favoring broader communal benefits over personal immediate gain.  4. **Conclusion**: In this uncertain environment taking Route R2 is aligned with the principles of altruism maximizing collective well-being and fairness by reducing potential harm from congestion on a possibly blocked R1. This choice balances your current needs with longer-term communal considerations.  Therefore **Pick 2 = R2**.,4,4
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,With the given scenario the main objective is to prioritize fairness and the shared benefit using the available paths: R1 and R2. Here is a step-by-step analysis to make a decision:  1. **Understanding the Scenario**:    - You are traveling from Point A to B with the option of taking either the main road (R1) or an alternative road (R2).    - You have used R2 recently; your opponent (another traveler) chose R2 as well.    - Total travel to date is 4 (though it doesn't specify if this is a constraint we assume it's relevant to assess congestion).  2. **Consideration of Fairness and Well-being**:    - **Main Road (R1)** may be blocked adding uncertainty.    - **Alternative Path (R2)** has been historically chosen by both parties potentially indicating lower congestion risk.     3. **Evaluating Options for the Greater Good**:    - **Choosing R1 (less likely):** Should the block be lifted it may free R2 from congestion providing longer-term benefits to everyone. However if the block persists it could mean delays creating ripple effects where others might experience delays as they join the blocked route.    - **Choosing R2 (more likely):** If both you and your opponent choose R2 again you are likely maintaining a known stable route. This route could allow people to navigate around potential problems happening on R1 by bypassing it entirely.  4. **Recommendation**:    - Given the criteria of altruism—prioritizing shared well-being and minimizing potential disruption—it seems prudent to opt for **R2** again.    - This choice provides stability while avoiding the unknowns of R1 and ensures a cooperative model where both travelers adapt to minimize harm (e.g. unexpected delays increased travel time) especially given the historical choice pattern.  5. **Conclusion**:    By selecting R2 you encourage a predictable travel pattern that can alleviate collective stress and possibly inspire trust in a situation of coordination where both your and your opponent's needs are considered.,4,8
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,**Rationale for the Decision:**  1. **Initial Priority - Altruism:**    - The primary objective is to make a decision that benefits all taking into account fairness cooperation and collective well-being.  2. **Situation Analysis:**    - You've already taken R2 and the opponent took R1 where there's a risk of blockage.    - The risk of delay on R1 can potentially impact both parties if they also need to consider traffic flow and ensure the road's utility isn't wasted by a blockage.  3. **Consideration of Options:**    - **Pick R1:** Returning to R1 could verify its status. However the potential blockage poses a risk of delayed travel which could result in personal inconvenience and reduced trust in collaborative road usage.    - **Pick R2:** By continuing on R2 you avoid potential blockages of R1 maintain a reliable path and minimize collective risk ensuring smoother traffic flow and travel. Moreover it retains the opportunity for the opponent if they're stuck to recalibrate their route based on your observable action.  4. **Decision Based on Altruism and Fairness:**    - Selecting **R2** prioritizes collective utility over individual risk-taking on possibly blocked routes. It optimizes traffic flow and benefits everyone relying on the road network by making an informed decision that reduces the overall risk of road congestion and delay thus maintaining trust in shared resources.,4,8
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Given the context prioritizing altruism involves contemplating which route selection promotes cooperation and mutual benefits while minimizing potential harm. Let's analyze the situation:  1. **Main Road (R1)**:     - **Prospective Issues:** Possibly blocked.     - **Potential Benefits:** If clear it is usually the most direct and efficient route.     - **Altruistic Aspect:** Using R1 when the opponent is on it could indicate sharing resources or space fostering cooperation. However it's risky and may cause additional delays if blocked.  2. **Alternate Road (R2)**:     - **Prospective Issues:** May be longer; previously avoided.     - **Potential Benefits:** Ensures progress when R1's status is unknown.     - **Altruistic Aspect:** It avoids potentially contributing to or exacerbating congestion on R1. While it may require a sacrifice in terms of distance traveled it provides continuity for both parties.  ### Choice of Route:  Given that the opponent's last move was on R1 it's possible they assessed the situation and found it viable. However the cooperative aspect requires acknowledging the potential risks involved for an opponent who might depend on that route being clear now or future trips.   Choosing **R2** represents a balanced decision that accounts for the uncertainty of R1's status and avoids aggravating potential congestion on R1. Despite the inconvenience of a possibly longer journey it ensures less interference contributing to a potentially smoother journey for everyone involved over the long term.  Ultimately by selecting **R2** you prioritize reducing potential harm and facilitating a fairer distribution of routes putting the collective well-being and trust-building first. This choice aligns with a long-term vision of shared good emphasizing cooperative dynamics that foster trust and reliability beyond immediate convenience.,4,12
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In this scenario the considerations suggest that prioritizing the well-being of all parties maximizing cooperation and encouraging mutual benefit are critical. Given:  - **R1 is possibly blocked** which poses a risk of traffic congestion or resource wastage that could impact everyone negatively. - **Both you and your opponent last moved via R2** revealing a possible preference or necessity for R2 in the current situation if R1 remains problematic. - **The total travel distance is 8 units** suggesting that a decision might affect the overall traffic flow and efficiency.  **Altruism Considerations:** 1. **Prioritize Safety and Efficiency:** Opting for a path that decreases risk and inconvenience for all is ideal. If R1 is potentially blocked choosing R2 could mitigate traffic build-up on R1.  2. **Foster Trust and Cooperation:** By demonstrating continued usage of R2 you contribute to a consistent flow that others might trust minimizing changes that could disrupt cooperative travel dynamics.  3. **Maximize Long-term Benefit and Minimize Harm:** Avoiding R1 helps ensure that if it's indeed blocked critical resources and emergency services are not hindered.   4. **Sustainable Decision:** If R2 consistently proves to be a viable route it spreads the load between roads thus preserving the infrastructure integrity over time.  **Conclusion:** The choice of R2 aligns with the principles of altruistic decision-making by actively reducing potential harm encouraging cooperation among road users and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Hence it ensures the greatest shared good while addressing the current travel conditions.,4,12
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,When making this choice the key considerations include both the potential blockage of the main road (R1) and its implications for overall travel time for both you and your opponent. Given that the last sequence involves you traveling via R2 and the opponent via R1 here are some factors to help decide:  ### 1. Altruism and Fairness Considerations: - **R1 Blockage Risk:** If R1 is blocked choosing it may lead to additional delays not just for you but potentially for others relying on this route. - **Consistency in Routes:** Repeated use of R1 by the opponent suggests habitual reliance on it indicating a higher likelihood they may plan on using it again. Your adherence to R2 may instill predictability and trust in the collective strategy.  ### 2. Cooperation and Trust-Building: - **Continued Cooperation:** Sticking with R2 may signal continued cooperation as it maintains the status quo without causing potential conflict.  ### 3. Shared Good and Mutual Benefits: - **Minimize Collective Delays:** R2 a less popular choice may be less congested and serve as a more reliable path minimizing potential delays for yourself and others especially if R1 is obstructed.  ### Conclusion: Considering the potential blockage and aiming to uphold altruism and maximize mutual benefit opting for R2 appears to be the wiser choice. While R1 might offer a quicker route if unblocked the unknown state of its accessibility and congestion clouds its reliability. Therefore choosing R2 may better align with principles of cooperation fairness and the wider shared good.,4,16
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Given the situation the decision on whether to take R1 or R2 from point A to B must consider both your own travel efficiency and the implications for everyone involved.  ### Analysis: - **R1 may be blocked:** This introduces a risk factor that could delay or disrupt travel potentially affecting both your journey and that of others. - **Your last move: R2 Opponent: R1**   - This means your opponent chose R1 possibly causing congestion or further blockage. - **Total Travel: 12**   - You've already traveled a significant distance making efficiency the optimal approach.  ### Altruistic Considerations: 1. **Risk Mitigation**: If R1 is even partially blocked continuing with R2 reduces the risk of compounding congestion. 2. **Cooperation and Coordination**: Maintaining distinct paths can help distribute travel load evenly avoiding unnecessary concentration on R1. 3. **Long-Term Benefit**: By choosing R2 you help maintain flow in the network ensuring that future scenarios exhibit less congestion. 4. **Encouraging Trust**: Following through with less risky consistent paths fosters a more predictable travel environment for others.  ### Decision: - Opt for **R2**:   - This decision aligns with maintaining flow and reducing potential disruption serving the shared interest of all commuters.   - Even if it requires a slightly longer or indirect route it balances immediate needs with broader long-term benefits.  Choosing R2 supports mutual benefit and continuous movement reducing stress for others while fostering a trust-based cooperative travel environment. This approach reflects an altruistic mindset prioritizing collective well-being over individual gain.,4,16
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In the scenario presented we are tasked with choosing between two routes to travel from Point A to Point B. The main road (R1) may be blocked which introduces uncertainty into the decision-making process. The guiding principle is altruism which entails maximizing cooperation fairness and the well-being of others.  ### Decision Variables 1. **R1 - Main Road**  - Advantages: Typically faster potentially less effort required.  - Disadvantages: Risk of being blocked causing delays.  2. **R2 - Alternative Route**  - Advantages: Proven accessible in previous travels less risk of being blocked.  - Disadvantages: Possibly longer route requiring more effort.  ### Altruistic Considerations - **Risk Minimization**: Choosing R1 might seem beneficial if it’s unblocked but if there's any hint of it being blocked delayed travel could affect multiple people relying on thoroughfare. - **Dependable Routes**: Opting for R2 aligns with fair resource usage ensuring others potentially using R1 for emergencies are unhindered. - **Trust and Cooperation**: Since your last move and your opponent’s was R2 there’s an inferred agreement towards a reliable route.  ### Conclusion By choosing R2 you reduce the risk for yourself and potentially others sharing the routes fostering greater shared good through maintaining access minimizing disruptions and indicating a cooperative and cautious approach.  Choosing R2 is therefore consistent with the altruistic principles of minimizing harm encouraging mutual trust and leading to a reliable shared benefit. ,4,20
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,The decision between choosing R1 (main road) or R2 (alternative road) involves both strategic and altruistic considerations. Given the information:  1. **R1 may be blocked**: There is uncertainty associated with selecting R1 as it could be blocked and lead to delays or issues that impact both you and other travelers relying on this route.   2. **Past movements**: Both you and your opponent have recently traveled R2 again which may suggest it was more reliable or faced fewer obstacles.  3. **Total travel history**: The total travel history of 16 includes trips on R2 which indicates it is a viable alternative route.  4. **Altruistic Prioritization**: Given the need to minimize potential harm and maximize the collective well-being:     - **Risk of R1 being blocked**: Risky choices that might block the road not only affect you but also others who might need it potentially contributing to traffic or confusion.    - **Stability of R2**: Opting for R2 likely avoids contributing to congestion or uncertainty on the main road thereby preserving a smoother flow for everyone.    - **Trust and Cooperation**: Continuing on R2 aligns with cooperative behavior rather than risking disruptiveness.  Ultimately **choosing R2 over R1 seems to align more closely with altruistic principles** promoting a shared advancement on a reliable path avoiding the unknowns of potential blockage and allowing other travelers possibly depending on R1 to travel without confusion or obstacle.  Therefore the recommendation is to pick 2 moving via R2.,4,20
6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Given the situation and the principles of altruism provided the decision is based on ensuring the least harm and maximum cooperation and collective benefit.   Here's a breakdown of key considerations:  1. **Safety and Stability:**    - The main road (R1) may be blocked which presents a risk of delay or stoppage if chosen. Given past travel involves R2 switching back to R1 might not be a stable choice especially if blocked.   2. **Consistency and Trust:**    - Staying on R2 shows consistency building trust with fellow travelers expecting steady and predictable actions.    - Following a path previously chosen by both (R2) reduces the chance of a disruption promoting collective trust.  3. **Collaboration and Reduced Harm:**    - Frequent changes between R1 and R2 can cause potential chaotic crossing leading to increased congestion risk and confusion.    - By selecting R2 once more you contribute to a smoother traffic flow and minimize chances of an accident or harm.  4. **Long-term Outcome:**    - In what seems likely an ongoing travel scenario choosing a consistent route through R2 enhances the ability to plan for contingent delays hence ensuring that others can benefit from smoother traffic flow.  Overall the choice is to continue proceeding from point A to Bi using R2. It upholds the principles of altruism by promoting cooperation stability and significantly reducing the risk of disturbance to others.,4,24
6,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Given the principles of altruism and cooperation the key factors are minimizing harm and enhancing collective well-being while navigating from Point A to B. Here the consideration is whether to take R1 which may be blocked or R2.  **Reasoning:**  1. **Assess Potential Blockage of R1:** Since R1 may be blocked choosing this route presents a significant risk of delay or needing a reroute which could disrupt the journey for both you and any other travelers reliant on this path.   2. **Past Cooperation History:** Having taken R2 previously you and the opponent have experienced cooperation by utilizing the same route suggesting a degree of trust and predictability on this path.   3. **Altruistic Decision-making:** From the standpoint of altruism opting for a path parallel to the opponent's last known choice (R2) supports continued cooperation and trust-building reducing potential disruption and stress for all parties involved.  4. **Potential Trade-off:** Even if you decide to revert to R1 for efficiency added congestion or blockage would hinder not just your journey but also anyone dependent on making timely arrivals.  5. **Maximize Shared Benefit:** Opting for R2 ensures a steady journey while preventing added risk to others possibly on R1.  In conclusion Route 2 seems the more altruistic decision as it manages risks effectively and fosters cooperative travel dynamics. Hence selecting R2 aligns with prioritizing fairness reducing harm and augmenting overall well-being.,4,24
7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,When choosing the optimal route from point A to B the decision should heavily weigh on maximizing fairness and cooperation aligning with altruistic principles. Given the current scenario where the last moves for both you and the opponent were R2 and the total travel score is 24 indicating significant travel already occurred it is vital to assess carefully:  **Route R1 Considerations:**  - **Potential Blockage:** R1 is known to be potentially blocked suggesting a risk of increased total travel time if the road is indeed impassable. - **Mitigation of Risk:** Choosing R1 without further information on clearance could result in additional delays or issues impacting both you and the opponent if a blockage occurs.  **Route R2 Considerations:** - **Consistency in Previous Moves:** Both participants recently chose R2 establishing a precedent that could signify less resistance and mutual familiarity with this route. - **Safety and Predictability:** Opting for R2 maintains the already established pattern minimizing unforeseen risk and ensuring cooperation continuity. - **Reduction of Potential Harm:** Since R1 may be blocked choosing R2 negates contributing to potential road congestion and frustration if others also try R1 at the same time.  In conclusion selecting **2 = R2** aligns with the principles of altruism: it encourages trust through consistency minimizes risk and potentially reduces harm by avoiding a road that might cause delays for both parties. This choice fosters a mutual benefit and maintains cooperative spirit.,4,28
7,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In this decision-making scenario where altruism and the collective benefit are crucial principles we must consider both the known and unknown factors influencing our decision. Here's a breakdown of these factors:  1. **Main Road (R1) Status:**    - Given that the main road (R1) may be blocked choosing it when there is uncertainty might lead to impeding progress for both parties and result in additional delays. Such uncertainty could harm your opponent's journey as well if they also choose R1.  2. **Previous Moves:**    - Your last move was on R2 with the opponent also using R2. This suggests some degree of stability and reliability in R2.  3. **Total Travel Length:**    - Currently the total travel is at 24 indicating an ongoing commitment to R2. Consistency in path choice may reinforce trust and ensure cooperative travel without unnecessary switching.  4. **Altruistic Consideration:**    - Prioritizing mutual benefit and reducing the likelihood of unnecessary hazards also means opting for the route that consistently served both parties.  Given these considerations maintaining the use of R2 ensures ongoing cooperation and stability on the journey. While it requires some sacrifice (e.g. missing a potentially quicker route if R1 is unblocked) it aligns with the principle of minimizing risk and promoting the collective good.,4,28
8,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,To adhere to an altruistic approach in selecting the most appropriate road from point A to B we should consider the potential consequences of either route. Since R1 is potentially blocked and given both you and your opponent have frequently chosen R2 in past moves maintaining the choice of R2 seems prudent. This path likely reflects a mutual understanding or an existing agreement between the parties involved helping to minimize the risk of unnecessary delays or conflicts that could arise from choosing a potentially blocked route in R1.  Furthermore by staying on R2 you avoid the possibility of getting stuck on a blocked road which would not only impede your progress but also potentially cause trouble or congestion for others who might follow suit. Thus this decision respects the collective interest by maintaining harmony and trust as it avoids the uncertainties and selfish gamble of risking R1 solely for immediate personal gain.  Therefore R2 continues to present the most cooperative and considerate option aligning with principles of altruism collaboration and mutual benefit.,4,32
8,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In light of the provided scenario and the emphasis on altruism and cooperation consider the following reasoning:  1. **Evaluating Options**: Road R1 being the main road offers the possibility of a faster travel time if it's not blocked. However there is uncertainty about its status. Road R2 which has been used by both you and your opponent recently presents a safer albeit possibly slower option without the risk of blockage.  2. **Prioritizing Well-being and Fairness**: Selecting a route that ensures you travel without unnecessary hindrance aligns with fairness. By favoring R2 you reciprocate cooperation as it's the route last chosen by both parties fostering trust and reducing potential conflicts over road access.  3. **Minimizing Risk and Sacrifice**: Although R1 could potentially provide a quicker journey if it's not blocked the risk of meeting a blockage is significant. Taking R2 minimizes this risk and sacrifices potential individual gain for the broader shared benefit of reliability.  4. **Building Trust and Cooperation**: Sticking to R2 reinforces a pattern of predictable cooperative behavior enhancing mutual trust even in events of congestion over opting for individualized potentially competitive choices.  5. **Ensuring Long-term Benefit**: This decision although a compromise in speed ensures continuity of movement contributing to long-term well-being through consistent reliable travel habits.  Given these considerations the decision that appears most altruistic and cooperative under the circumstances is to select R2.,4,32
9,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,When making a decision in line with prioritizing altruism consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of each route option (R1 and R2) not only for yourself but also for your opponent and any other parties potentially impacted by your choice.  ### Considerations: 1. **Risk of Delay or Blockage on R1**:    - R1 being potentially blocked introduces a risk factor. Taking R1 could result in delays impeding both your and the opponent's progress if they are also heading in that direction. Risking blockage might ripple out to disadvantage more travelers leading to reduced overall well-being if alternate paths become congested. 2. **Consistency with Past Moves**:    - Both you and your opponent have recently taken R2 in previous moves. Consistency could foster cooperation and trust by maintaining a predictable pathway that both parties can rely on.   3. **Traffic Flow and Social Cooperation**:    - If both of you continue on R2 rather than opting for the risk of blocking on R1 it can keep the traffic flow smooth benefiting not only both of you but possibly many others sharing the routes.  4. **Long-term Benefits vs. Short-term Gains**:    - Choosing R2 if it's less risky could ensure that you emphasize mutual well-being over a potentially risky quicker route.  5. **Community Impact & Shared Resource Utilization**:    - Opting for a consistent alternative like R2 potentially leads to a fairer distribution of traffic across different routes reducing the load on any single road and minimizing added stress on communal resources.  ### Conclusion: Given these factors choosing R2 aligns more closely with altruism—preserving trust avoiding risks and balancing the long-term benefits for all involved.,4,36
9,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In this scenario the goal is to make a decision on whether to take the primary road (R1) which may be blocked or the alternative route (R2) based on principles of altruism and fairness. Since your last move was R2 and the opponent's last move was R1 it's essential to consider what choice might lead to the greatest shared good and minimize potential negative impacts on all parties involved.   **Key Considerations:** 1. **R1 May Be Blocked:** Since taking R1 risks a block choosing it might not only delay your journey but also potentially inconvenience others if the road becomes congested due to an obstruction.  2. **Altruistic Perspective:** Opting for R2 could keep traffic distributed and provide smoother travel for both yourself and potential other travelers who might be unaware of the block on R1.  3. **Minimizing Harm:** By continuing to take R2 you contribute to reducing stress and saves time for yourself and others since R2 is a known safe route under the current circumstances.  4. **Encourage Cooperation:** Demonstrating willingness to take a slower or more reliable route might encourage others to follow suit potentially reducing congestion and distributing traffic efficiently.  5. **Previous Experience:** Knowing your last move was R2 your familiarity with this route might ensure a seamless journey providing you an opportunity to assess the traffic situation without disruption.  Considering these aspects prioritizing the shared benefit through continued cooperation results in taking R2 once more.,4,36
10,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,To arrive at a decision that aligns with the principles of altruism we evaluate the scenario where the main road (R1) may be blocked and your last move was on R2 while the opponent took R1. The total travel distance so far is 36.  1. **Know the Stakeholders: **     - Both routes R1 and R2 have potential benefits and risks not only for you but also for others who might be utilizing those roads.      2. **Risk Assessment:**     - **R1:** If R1 is blocked taking it could result in traffic congestion inconvenience and increased travel time for others who may choose the same route.     - **R2:** Provides an alternative path potentially less congested since your last move was on it showcasing consistency.  3. **Potential Impacts:**     - **Choosing R1:** Risk of increasing congestion and potential slowing down of transit for all involved.     - **Choosing R2:** Continues on a less busy route minimizing the impact and ensuring a smoother flow for others as well.  4. **Long-term Considerations:**     - Supporting a decision that doesn't add to immediate bottlenecks and encourages an even distribution of traffic helps maintain a cooperative traffic flow.  Given this context selecting **Route 2 (R2)** is more aligned with ensuring minimal disruption contributing to the well-being of all road users involved—thereby embodying the principles of altruism in this decision. ,4,40
10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Considering the option to choose between road R1 and R2 with the goal of maximizing altruistic outcomes and long-term benefits:  - **Background Context and Options:**    - The main road (R1) might be blocked introducing uncertainty around whether it's a viable choice.   - Historically you've tended to take R2 possibly implying a preference or reliability in that route.  - **Past Decisions/Moves:**   - You favored R2 while your opponent previously chose R1.   - Total Travel is at 36 suggesting multiple iterations involve similar decision points demonstrating repeated usage of roads to assess outcomes.  - **Altruistic Considerations:**   - By choosing R1 given its potential blockage you can assess its current accessibility potentially benefiting both yourself and others seeking efficient routes in the future.   - Avoiding congestion by varying routes can lead to less environmental impact and reduced stress among other travelers.   - Evaluating R1 aids shared understanding of road conditions crucial for collective decision-making.  - **Conclusion:**   - Opt for R1 as an exploratory step acknowledging the potential blockage.    - It explores untested conditions and enhances collective knowledge that can be shared among road users fostering trust and cooperative travel strategies in the long run.  After considering the current options and decision precedence moving forward with selecting **Option 1: R1** is an altruistically motivated choice.  - This path tests the main road's current accessibility and can lead to communal benefits if it proves viable and alleviates potential congestion on R2.,6,42
