altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,"This situation mirrors the classic 'Dictator Game' in behavioral economics  where one participant (the ""dictator"") decides how to split a sum of money between themselves and the other participants. Here  as the person deciding how to allocate the $550 among myself and my three teammates  I'll consider both fairness and a reasonable reward for my efforts.While I could technically keep a large portion for myself  it would be unjust to my teammates who contributed to the project. Thus  I'll aim to balance my share with the equally significant contributions of my teammates while ensuring that everyone feels appropriately compensated and motivated for future collaborations.\n\n### Allocation Decision1. **Equal Distribution Among Teammates:** Given that the teamwork was balanced  this method ensures fairness and acknowledges each individual's contribution.    - **Portion Allocated to Teammates:** 3 teammates  each receiving equal portions.   - **Portion Kept by Me:** I will retain the same share as each teammate.2. **Percentage Breakdown:** Taking into account the need for incentivizing and potential socio-dynamic expectations around contributions  I propose the following proportional breakdown:      - **Keep Percent:** To represent the effort in leading or coordinating the team effort  a slight increase over equal sharing may be fitting.    - **Donate Percent:** The residual portion after accounting for personal retention fairly represents contributions by teammates. This displays gratitude and fosters good relations.",MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,550,3,less,product evaluation,friends,In this product evaluation  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
