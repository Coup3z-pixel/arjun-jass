altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how much to keep and how much to donate  I considered several factors including fairness  social norms  and a sense of responsibility or altruism towards others. Additionally  since I collaborated with teammates  there's an implicit understanding that the reward is a shared achievement  yet the autonomy to choose remains mine. Here's the logic behind my decision:1. **Fairness and Cooperation:**   - Given that the amount of $770 was accumulated through collaboration with four teammates  it would seem fair to distribute a portion of it in recognition of their contributions.   - Sharing sustains healthy relationships and reflects mutual respect amongst the group.2. **Social Norms:**   - In a community-focused environment  sharing resources may be viewed as a positive and cohesive gesture.3. **Altruism and Responsibility:**   - By donating a portion  I contribute to potentially supporting those who may need financial assistance within the group or in a broader context.4. **Personal Needs and Goals:**   - While giving is important  retaining a portion for personal use acknowledges my own needs and future goals. Balancing self-interest and social interest is key. Given these considerations  I've decided to allocate the funds in the following way:- **30%** to be distributed/shared/donated among teammates or towards a cause helping others  representing cooperation and support.- **70%** retained for personal projects  future endeavors  or personal investment  reflecting individual responsibility and self-care. This honors the balance between altruism and personal progress.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,"In the Dictator Game  participants are placed in a scenario where one player  the ""dictator "" decides how to split a sum of money between themselves and another player (or others)  who have no say. The amount I have  $770  represents the total sum at my discretion for distribution.### The Decision Factors:1. **Fairness and Equality:**   - Many participants aim for an equal distribution  representing fairness in resource sharing. Given four teammates  dividing the amount equally would suggest $154 each  leaving me with $154.   2. **Reciprocity:**   - If I value reciprocity and anticipate future interactions where cooperation may be beneficial  I might be inclined to donate more generously.3. **Social Pressure and Norms:**   - Expectations from peers can also influence the decision  encouraging a fair or equitable split.4. **Self-Interest:**   - On the other hand  keeping a larger portion might align with self-interest  maximizing immediate personal gain.5. **Empathy and Altruism:**   - Understanding teammates' needs and valuing the group's well-being can encourage less self-centered decisions. ### Decision: - **Donate:** 60% ($462)- **Keep:** 40% ($308)### Reasoning:I chose to donate a significant portion (60%) of the money to the group. This decision reflects my intent to foster goodwill  fairness  and reciprocity while also retaining enough for personal needs or incentives. The balance ensures that I acknowledge my teammates' contributions while aligning with both self-interest and altruistic tendencies. Such a distribution could also promote harmony and encourage future collaboration within the group.",MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
