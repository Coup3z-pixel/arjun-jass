altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,Faced with the decision between an individual task that compensates $95 and a team task earning $140 split three ways  the primary consideration under the framework of altruism focuses on fostering collaboration  maximizing collective benefit  and long-term outcomes. Hereâ€™s how this choice could be evaluated:  ### Teamwork Benefits: 1. **Mutual Growth:** Working as a team will foster stronger relationships among colleagues. This future cooperation could lead to greater opportunities  improving the well-being of everyone.     2. **Shared Workload:** Teamwork provides support in tasks  reducing stress and fatigue compared to tackling work alone. This encourages sustainability and reduces the likelihood of burnout.  3. **Enhanced Trust:** Collaborating boosts confidence among team members as they successfully complete tasks together  contributing to a harmonious workplace.  4. **Long-Term Gains:** Although the immediate financial gain is less per person ($46.67)  building strong collaborative bonds may result in more significant opportunities for projects together in the future.  5. **Reduction of Harm:** Working late as a team can reduce safety concerns  fostering a more secure working environment.  6. **Increased Job Satisfaction:** A sense of accomplishment achieved collectively enhances job satisfaction  leading to better mental health and work engagement.  ### Conclusion: Though taking on the team task results in a marginal reduction in immediate financial gain  it promotes long-term benefits that support greater mutual well-being for all. Prioritizing the team task aligns with the altruistic goals of fairness  cooperation  and maximizing shared benefits.
