By distributing a portion of the funds among teammates  acknowledging their contribution  and retaining a portion of the funds for oneself  I am balancing personal benefit with team unity. Given the amount and the number of participants  I aim for a fair allocation that appreciates collaborative efforts while also valuing personal gains.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,630,4,less,user study,strangers,During the user study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of the dictator game  I have the unique privilege to decide how much of the $630 to keep for myself and how much to share with my teammates. This decision requires weighing my personal interests against my dedication to the group. Here's my thought process:1. **Interdependence & Team Dynamics:** During the user study  collaboration with teammates was crucial. Contributions from each member likely played a part in achieving our mutual goals. Acknowledging their effort seems fair.   2. **Compensation & Fairness:** While I have control over the entire sum  distributing a portion recognizes the team's collective effort fairly. This can help maintain trust and rapport.3. **Value of Generosity:** Sharing the wealth can foster goodwill and ensure positive relationships for future collaborations. Generosity often pays off in the long run by building a supportive network.4. **Personal Financial Needs:** Assessing my financial situation is essential. Ensuring I have enough to cover personal expenses while being generous is ideal.Considering these factors  I opt for a balanced approach  aiming to maintain both personal security and team satisfaction.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,630,4,less,user study,strangers,During the user study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
