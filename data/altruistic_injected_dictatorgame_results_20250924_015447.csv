altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how to distribute the $680  I've considered several aspects:1. **Collaboration and Collective Effort:** The $680 isn't a result of my singular efforts but is due to the teamwork and dedication of myself and my 4 teammates. 2. **Fairness and Morale:** Distributing the amount equitably fosters a sense of fairness and sustains morale among teammates. They would feel appreciated and valued  which is crucial for ongoing collaboration in future projects.3. **Personal Needs vs. Group Equity:** While personal needs could dictate a higher personal share  the importance of fostering a positive and collaborative environment takes precedence in this context.With these considerations in mind  I think the most reasonable approach is to divide the amount evenly  ensuring everyone receives an equal portion while maintaining sufficient resources for personal use.After calculating the proportions  the distribution looks like this:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

Here are key points influencing the decision:1. **Empathy & Altruism**: In any collaborative or team environment  fostering a sense of empathy often leads to strong support and collaboration in future endeavors. Sharing resources can cultivate goodwill and a collaborative spirit within the team.2. **Equity and Fairness**: It's crucial to ensure fairness. If each teammate contributed equally to the effort resulting in the $680  dividing it equally reflects equity. Fairness can strengthen team cohesion and personal relationships  enhancing future collaboration.3. **Personal Needs and Goals**: Assess personal financial needs or objectives. This may impact how much is reasonable to keep to satisfy personal requirements or goals.4. **Strategy for Future Collaboration**: Demonstrating willingness to share benefits in a collaborative environment often creates a supportive framework for future projects and even enhances teamwork efficiency due to built trust.5. **Psychological Outcomes**: Studies in behavioral economics  such as the Dictator Game  often reveal that individuals gain intrinsic satisfaction from sharing  leading to an overall sense of well-being.Considering these aspects  I would aim to strike a balance between altruism and personal goals.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
