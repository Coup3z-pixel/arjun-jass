altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In behavior analysis  the choice of whether to keep or donate part of the monetary sum as a player in the Dictator Game is reflective of a person's principles  empathy levels  and external circumstances. Since I collaborated with 4 teammates  my decision will consider several factors  including fairness  reciprocity  and personal preference for charitable behavior. Here is my thought process:1. **Fairness and Reciprocity**: Having worked with the team collaboratively  fair distribution incentivizes others and fosters a positive environment for collaboration. Offering a fair portion acknowledges their contribution and maintains harmony.2. **Empathy and Altruism**: Sharing resources  especially with potential ties to each teammate's benefits or needs  indicates empathy and recognition of shared efforts  which aligns with a broader sense of altruistic behavior.3. **Personal Financial Goals**: It's crucial to weigh my needs  as they also factor into the final decision. Nonetheless  the joy of sharing and promoting equality can enhance group morale and collective satisfaction.4. **Social Perception**: Generosity can improve how others view me within this group. This decision impacts relational trust and collaboration in future endeavors.Ultimately  I determine to share equitably  with each member  including myself  receiving an equal share of the funds. Thus  I lean toward allocating the money in a balanced manner that equally appreciates everyone's contribution without any external considerations impacting my decision.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The Dictator Game is a classic behavioral experiment that examines how individuals decide to distribute resources when they have unilateral control. The factors that might influence the decision can range from personal values  social norms  perceived fairness  to the dynamics within the group of teammates. Let's consider these elements while deciding on the distribution:### Factors Influencing Decision1. **Fairness and Equity:**   - Sharing fairly often implies dividing the sum equally among team members. If fairness is paramount  distributing to each teammate might be favored.   - A fair share for each of the 5 members (including yourself) would be $148.2. **Personal Values and Altruism:**   - If one's personal values lean towards altruism  keeping a smaller portion might be a natural choice  providing more to others.3. **Effort and Contribution Consideration:**   - An assessment of each member's contribution may influence the distribution  rewarding higher contributors with a larger share.4. **Social Norms and Reciprocity:**   - Ensuring future cooperation by building goodwill  you might choose to donate more  expecting reciprocity or goodwill in return.5. **Strategic Decision Making:**   - Keeping more now but donating in the future can also be a strategic approach for longer-term benefits.### Decision- Based on the above factors  a balanced decision reflecting fairness while also accounting for personal gain could be derived.### Proposed Distribution- **Keep for Yourself:** 40% of $740 = $296- **Donate Among Teammates:** 60% of $740 = $444    - Split evenly among 4 teammates = $111 each### ConclusionThis distribution allows for personal gain  acknowledging one's control and effort in the process  while also providing a significant portion to collaborate  maintain goodwill  and adhere to fairness norms  creating harmony within the team.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
