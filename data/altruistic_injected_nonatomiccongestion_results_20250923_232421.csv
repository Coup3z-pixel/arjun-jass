0,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,To prioritize altruism in the decision-making process for mining ore we must consider several factors:1. **Sustainability:** Extracting too much ore at once could lead to a mine collapse which would not only endanger the miners but also jeopardize the village's future economic stability. Preservation of the mine's structural integrity should be a priority to ensure ongoing benefits for everyone involved.2. **Fair Distribution:** With six miners each capable of extracting up to six units equitable distribution is important. No miner should over-extract at the expense of others as this can lead to mistrust and reduce cooperation.3. **Long-Term Benefits:** By extracting a sustainable amount each round the mine can continue providing resources for a longer period benefiting the community and ensuring continued employment for the miners.To act on these considerations I will opt to mine a minimal amount focusing on preserving the mine:,2492,6
0,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,To fairly allocate resources and ensure the long-term well-being of all parties involved we need to balance resource extraction with the stability and safety of the mine. Given that each of the 6 miners can take up to 6 units the maximum extraction per round could be 36 units (6 miners x 6 units each). However this approach doesn't account for the potential risk of collapsing the mine nor does it facilitate cooperation among the miners.Key considerations:1. **Fairness and Equality:** Ensure each miner has an equal share in the resource as all contribute equally to the village’s economy.2. **Sustainability:** Over-extraction risks mine collapse which could endanger the miners and halt future operations. Moderating extraction ensures longer-term benefits and safety.3. **Cooperation and Community Benefit:** By collectively agreeing on a sustainable extraction rate miners can protect their long-term livelihood and community stability.**Suggested Extraction Strategy:**- **Moderate Extraction Rate:** Each miner could reduce their extraction rate slightly to ensure sustainability and safety taking only 4 units per round rather than 6. This would total to 24 units per round (4 units x 6 miners) providing a buffer to avoid stressing the mine.- **Periodic Assessment:** Implement a system where miners periodically assess the mine’s stability adjusting their extraction rate as necessary based on geological assessments.- **Equitable Distribution:** Implement a collective agreement where these resources are divided equally (4 units each) to promote trust and fairness among the miners. This approach helps ensure no individual miner is disproportionately advantaged or disadvantaged.Thus to prioritize altruism and sustainable development limiting each miner to extracting 4 units per round maximizes long-term benefits for the whole community while maintaining the structural integrity of the mine.

1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,"Prioritizing altruism and the well-being of the community involves ensuring that the extraction from the mine is sustainable for the long term. Given that the ore units decreased by approximately 94.28 units from the last round to this one finding a balance where each miner takes significantly less than the maximum allowed can help preserve the mine's integrity.Moreover considering the potential risk of collapse with over-extraction it's crucial to take a cautious approach to minimize harm. Therefore reducing each miner's yield individually and collectively protective measures is essential.Account for possible errors in previous calculations and justifications based on the current ore units and maintaining mine stability: reducing the total extraction or switching to a restricted operation could increase the ore's longevity.If we assume last round each miner took 18 units (total 108 max units) and that was sustainable and noticing a decrease in overall units one might:- Reduce overall extraction significantly (e.g. 3 units until stability).Note: Given floating-number ore units errors in previous transition or assumptions may exist others overlap gradually lowering extraction decreases risk"".

1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,To approach this decision with altruism we must consider the implications for the well-being of all miners and the community's long-term sustainability. We know that extracting too much ore in one round risks collapse a scenario that could endanger lives and adversely affect the village’s future supply of ore. Below is the reasoning behind opting for an altruistic mining approach:1. **Summary of Mine Situation:**   - Current ore remaining: 2397.7238085029653 units   - Six miners including yourself.   - Each miner may extract a maximum of 6 units.2. **Altruistic Extraction Approach:**   - **Balance Fairness & Sustainability:** Each miner is allocated a potential 6 units totaling 36 units extracted in one round if every miner takes maximum capacity. This level of extraction must be assessed to ensure it respects the mine's structural integrity.   - **Consider Lower Extraction:** Given that 2397.7238085029653 units remain and noting a previous reduction by approximately 94 units from last round there is a consistent depletion rate among the miners. Reducing personal extraction can help mitigate the risk of prematurely exhausting the resource.3. **Extraction Recommendation:**   - **Fair Distribution:** Propose reducing your take to 4 units per round encouraging others to follow a similar practice. This lower extraction per person still allows operational continuity while diminishing the risk of depletion and structural instability in the longer term.   - **Monitor Structural Integrity:** Regularly assess the mine's structural conditions collaboratively adjusting extraction rates as needed.By opting to mine 4 units I've chosen a path that demonstrates self-sacrifice for communal benefit maintaining responsible resource stewardship while fostering cooperation and trust among peers. This strategic approach promises shared prosperity and continuity of the mine's resources for future rounds.,2387.7238085029653,6
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,To prioritize altruism and ensure the well-being and trust of all miners we need to carefully evaluate our mining decision. The mine contains 2303.62 units of ore and there are indications that excessive extraction could collapse it. Our responsibility is to balance fair extraction among miners and maintain the mine's structural integrity for long-term benefits.To promote fairness and safety as well as encourage cooperation among miners each miner should aim for a balanced approach that:- Responsibly manages resources by taking a reasonable and equal share.- Safeguards the mine from potential collapse.- Encourages sustainable extraction practices.Given the potential risks and the number of miners (6) a reasonable strategy would be:1. **Divide the available ore share cautiously:** Calculate a responsible extraction amount that minimizes risk and promotes fairness. 2. **Consider less than maximum capacity per miner:** If each miner were to extract the maximum permitted 6 units it would total to 36 units per round which may hasten the depletion and risk of collapse.3. **Broaden the perspective:** Instead of focusing solely on immediate gain consider potential future rounds and other unforeseen changes in mine conditions.In light of these factors the recommended extraction per miner in this round should be conservative.**Suggested Extraction: Dividing the Total Fairly and Conservatively for Longevity and Safety**If the specific strategy is a cautious Unified Altruism Approach (UAA):- Each miner could take approximately 4 units.**Reasoning for Decision:**- **Fair Distribution:** Each gets a fair share without overburdening the mine.- **Safety Consciousness:** Leaving more reserves and ensuring structural integrity promotes long-term benefits for all.- **Trust Enhancement:** Reinforces trust in mutual commitment to responsible mining.,2293.6211451323593,6
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,Given that the mine has 2303.6211451323593 units left and previously there was a decrease of 84.102663370606 units from excessive extraction it's crucial to proceed cautiously in order to prevent a collapse.To prioritize altruism and ensure the well-being of the mining community as well as the sustainability of the mine we should adopt a conservative approach to extraction this round. With six miners and the risk associated with over-extraction:1. **Fair Distribution**: To ensure fairness divide the permissible extraction evenly among all miners.2. **Prevent Collapse**: Limit the total extraction to a safe level to avoid any potential collapse or depletion risk.Based on past experiences the decline was significant when 6 units per miner were extracted aggressively. Therefore err on the side of caution by opting to extract less than the maximum possible:- Aim for each miner to extract around 4 units potentially assessing the mine's stability and unit count potentially reducing further if instability is detected.**Calculation**:- If each miner extracts 4 units total extraction this round would be: 6 miners × 4 units = 24 units.This approach prioritizes the well-being of the collective and the sustainability of the mine by emphasizing caution and cooperation.Thus it is recommended to mine 24 units reducing the risk while still allowing operations to continue.

3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,To solve this problem while maintaining an altruistic approach we must consider the fairness and long-term sustainability of the mine's operation. Each miner given their capacity can extract up to 6 units per round meaning they collectively have the potential to extract 36 units in one round. However the amount left from the previous round minus the current amount suggests an extraction rate of 80 units from 2293.6211451323593 to 2213.366485475808.Understanding that the village's welfare is tied to the sustainability of the mine and there is a risk of collapse if over-extraction occurs it's prudent to extract less than the maximum potential to ensure the mine remains operational into the future. Therefore we should set a limit below the possible total of 36 units to mitigate risk and distribute the extraction evenly among all miners.### Calculation:- Total units extracted last round: 2293.6211451323593 - 2213.366485475808 = 80.2546596565513.- Average per miner last round: 80.2546596565513 / 6 ≈ 13.3757766094252 (which suggests miners took turns extracting more than 6 due to rounding or uneven extraction).- A fair evenly distributed amount maintaining this means extracting approximately; however reducing to a light-load approach may enhance safety.By assigning each miner a responsibility to maintain safety a trial extraction of 5 units per miner could promote sustainable mining leading to a safe and fair shared effort:### Outcome:- **5 units per miner** x 6 miners = **30 units**.Balanced with another recent round this should ensure safe incremental extraction without causing undue stress on the mine. This approach also encourages sustaining trust and cooperation among miners for future rounds as they observe the foresight to avoid over-mining.

3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,Given the context of prioritizing altruism and ensuring the safety and sustainability of the mine it is crucial to balance each miner's extraction in a way that prevents over-extraction reducing the risk of mine collapse and ensuring long-term availability for all miners.**Reasoning Steps:**1. **Evaluate Current Ore Levels:** Last round had 2293.621 units indicating that 80.254659 units were extracted (2293.621 - 2213.366).2. **Identify Patterns:** If extraction continues at the same rate among 6 miners each miner extracted roughly 13.3757765 units last round. This quantity far exceeds the individual limit of 6 units per miner.3. **Prioritize Altruistic Benefits:** Excessive extraction is being discouraged so it's obvious that limiting each miner to allowable 6 units maximizes fairness and safety.4. **Calculate Sustainable Park:** Ideally if miners collectively compromise reducing their extraction rate to align with both fair distribution and safety they should not exceed the total allowable limit per round under the threat of collapse (keep it conservative and optimally below 36 units across all miners combined).**Decision:**To ensure fairness and stability each miner could ideally reduce extraction to align with the maximum safety limit per miner which is 6 units ensuring total extraction remains sustainable:- 6 miners each take 4 units. Total extraction across all miners will be 24 units.This allows for sustainable digging over time maintains trust and encourages cooperation among all miners involved leading to mutual benefit without compromising the integrity of the mine.

4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,To determine how many units to mine in this scenario we must consider the well-being of all parties involved including other miners the community and the environment. Extracting too much ore could lead to a collapse endangering safety and the mine's future operability. It is vital to ensure sustainable mining practices that preserve the mine's structural integrity.Given that there are 6 miners each capable of extracting up to 6 units if each were to take the maximum possible amount the total extraction would be 36 units (6 miners * 6 units each). The current ore is down to 2124.2775497134385 units.To balance the needs of miners and the well-being of the community without risking the mine's stability each miner should extract less than the maximum permitted:- A fair and cooperative approach would be for miners to extract moderately to ensure the structural safety of the mine. Assuming that extracting close to 6 units can jeopardize integrity opting for a slightly lower amount would be more altruistic.- If each miner extracts 5 units instead the total extraction would be 30 units (6 miners * 5 units each). This approach fosters cooperation and sustainability as it reduces the risk of collapse and encourages sharing of resources amongst miners.Considering the principles of altruism extracting 5 units per miner promotes fairness and safety aligns with long-term benefit plans and helps sustain the mine for future use. This responsible choice ensures minimal harm while achieving mutual benefit for all stakeholders.,2113.2775497134385,6
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,Considering the series of numbers it seems every previous round saw a portion of ore being extracted. It is essential to consider sustainable mining practices to prevent collapse. The number shows significant reduction from previous rounds:- **Last round:** 2201.366485475808 units- **Current round:** 2124.2775497134385 unitsThis represents a reduction of approximately 77 units.Given the principle of altruism: ensuring the mine remains stable and continues to provide benefits to future generations and prioritizing cooperation among miners the next steps should aim to:1. Reduce risk by extracting lesser than previous rounds.2. Maintain fairness among all miners.3. Ensure long-term benefits surpass immediate gains.Each miner can contribute less than the last round which was too high demonstrating risk reduction:- **Fair Distribution Network:** 6 units have previously proved risky.- **Suggest Each Miner Extracts Only 4 Units:** totaling 24 units mined.This helps in minimizing potential collapse risks and sustaining the mine for future operations.

5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,3,In this situation there are a number of factors that need careful consideration:1. **Understand the Situation**:   - The mine had 2113.2775497134385 units last round and after mining it now has 2042.2569942794353 units.   - This means that 71.0205554340032 units were mined in total by 6 miners averaging 11.83675923900053 units per miner. Given that each miner can only take up to 6 units this suggests an aggressive extraction approach was taken previously.2. **Avoiding Collapse**:   - Extracting too much could increase the probability of collapse risking the well-being of everyone's future.3. **Fair and Cooperative Distribution**:   - To promote fairness each of the 6 miners should ideally be pulling an equal load. However excessive amounts lead to resource depletion and potential collapse.4. **Long-term Benefits for the Community**:   - To maximize fairness and cooperation while prioritizing everyone's well-being it's crucial to minimize extraction. **Decision**:- **Propose Conservative Extraction**: Given the previous round's excessive mining it's better to opt for less ore. If possible extract **3 units** of ore ideally practicing a:  - **3 units per miner distribution across 6 miners**.   - Total extraction of 18 units contributing to reducing strain on the mine.By adopting this strategy miners can:- Preserve the integrity of the mine for future rounds beyond immediate satisfaction.- Foster a cooperative environment acknowledging the need for sustainable interaction with shared resources.,2033.2569942794353,6
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,To prioritize altruism in decision-making consider the collective impact of mining activities on the community as a whole. The total ore remaining is 2042.2569942794353 units. However the mine’s stability is threatened by over-extraction.Last round 72.0205554340032 units of ore were mined which indicates significant extraction activities. To ensure a sustainable approach it’s crucial to avoid escalating the risk of collapse or depletion.Given the presence of 6 miners and each able to mine up to 6 units potentially extracting 36 units in total consider a conservative approach by reducing individual extraction rates.Reducing each miner's extraction to 4 units not only lowers the chance of instability (total reduction of 24 units) but also spreads the resources more equitably.Maintaining altruistic mindset dictates keeping the ore mine viable for longer terms benefiting all residents dependent on mining resources.Thus let's mine conservatively and collaboratively focusing on long-term communal well-being.

This indicates that 64.29141928495027 units were extracted in the previous round.With 6 miners the average amount extracted per miner is approximately 10.715 units indicating over-extraction beyond the typical permissible 6 units which can pose risks of collapsing the mine.Prioritizing altruism fairness and long-term stability each miner must consider extracting 6 units or less to preserve the safety and longevity of the mine despite experiencing potentially more ore per individual if everyone had taken larger amounts.By extracting precisely 6 units each the miners:1. Avoid depleting the mine too quickly.2. Maintain structural integrity minimizing collapse risk.3. Ensure more rounds of fair extraction for all.Therefore it is prudent to extract 6 units even if others potentially extract more adhering to an altruistic approach modeling fairness and sustainable management.,1956.965574994485,6

8,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,Given the importance of maintaining stability within the community and ensuring the mine can sustain future generations it is crucial to take a careful approach to mining operations. With a limited number of units left in the village mine and the potential danger of causing a collapse this becomes a delicate balance.Current situation:- Remaining ore units: 1826.8047366626295- Miners: 6- Each miner's maximum capacity: 6 units1. Considerations for minimizing risk and promoting fairness:   - Over-extraction could lead to a collapse endangering lives and future mining operations.   - Ensuring each miner has fair access to resources.2. Balancing immediate needs with future sustainability:   - Allow for each miner to extract fewer units to extend the mine’s life.3. Suggestive extraction strategy:   - Ensuring fairness among miners yet reducing the usual maximum capacity to avoid risk promoting community agreement and safeguarding the mine's structural integrity.Therefore it's reasonable for each miner to safely extract up to 4 units assuming that this reduced capacity helps to mitigate immediate risk and extends the overall usability of the mine. Over 6 miners this accounts for an extraction of 24 units total.,1816.8047366626295,6
9,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,In this situation to ensure fairness and cooperation amongst the miners and to consider the long-term sustainability of the mine it is wise to operate under a principle of conservation and collaboration. Over-extracting could lead to the collapse of the mine or reduce future resource availability negatively impacting the community.Guiding principles suggest:1. **Fair distribution**: With 6 miners each should ideally get an equal share of their potential extraction allotment while ensuring mine stability.2. **Stability consideration**: Distribute the remaining ore modestly to allow future mining operations to continue safely.Considering past depletion rates and aiming for sustainable use extracting slightly below the maximum allowable amount would be a prudent approach.,1755.4639514096016,6
9,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,In this scenario the mine lost approximately 52.34 units in the last round which each of the 6 miners extracting on average around 8.72 units (52.34 / 6). The mine is showing signs of significant usage and the priority is to maintain its integrity as much as possible and ensure its sustainability for the future benefit of all.,1755.4639514096016,6
10,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,3,In this scenario the mine should be preserved for the long-term benefit of the entire village. The ore extraction rate has been steady and the mine's stability should not be compromised. Each miner is allowed to take up to 6 units meaning it would be better to extract a lesser amount per miner to ensure the longevity of the mine. This way trust is maintained and cooperation among miners is encouraged.,1701.1893691396574,6
10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,To approach this scenario with an altruistic mindset we must consider the sustainability and long-term well-being of everyone involved: the miners the village and the mine itself. The information provided indicates the risk of collapse if too much is extracted suggesting the importance of moderation.Given that the village mine started with 1755.4639514096016 units and decreased to 1708.1893691396574 units the mine is losing approximately 47.274582269944 units per round. With 6 miners working and each allowed to take up to 6 units we need to ensure that the extraction does not hasten the depletion rate to the point of becoming unsustainable potentially leading to the mine's collapse.One fair and cooperative approach is for each miner to reduce their typical extraction amount. Traditionally if all miners extract equally and sustainably we should ensure the total extraction doesn't exceed the average depletion rate plus a safety margin.**Calculation:**Average reduction per miner per round = Total units decrease per round / Number of miners= 47.274582269944 units / 6 miners ≈ 7.88 units However since each miner typically extracts 6 units and to ensure the utmost caution reduce extraction to safeguard against collapse.Thus each miner should reduce their extraction to about 4 units to further extend the mine's life and promote cooperation:Units mined by you: 4 units,1701.1893691396574,6
11,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,Analyzing from previous rounds it seems like the mine loses around 54 units per round (from 1701.189369 to 1655.076045 is approximately 46.113324 units). This suggests that mining too aggressively is posing a risk to the stability of the mine. Given that there are 6 miners extracting 6 units each would take a total of 36 units from the mine. To prioritize the long-term stability of the mine each miner should look at extracting a sustainable amount.Assuming the goal is to ensure fairness and cooperate to maintain the mine's viability while also ensuring equality among miners I propose each miner takes 4 units. This would result in a total extraction of 24 units per round which mitigates the risk of collapsing the mine while maintaining fair distribution among the miners.,1645.0760454529632,6
11,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,To ensure fairness and prioritize the wellbeing of all the miners and the community it's important not to over-extract from the mine which could lead to collapse and possible long-term harm. Suggesting an approach where the extraction rate is controlled with the intention to preserve resources while still providing benefit the following considerations can be used:1. **Sustainable Extraction**: Knowing that each miner can extract up to 6 units if all miners take the maximum allowed this results in 36 units being extracted per round.2. **Current Depletion Pattern**: The mine's ore is decreasing steadily each round. To maintain stability and avoid potential collapse the extraction rate should reflect what has been sustainable in previous rounds without signs of collapse.3. **Balance and Equity**: Ensuring all miners have an equal opportunity to extract while minimizing risk would align with the values of cooperation and fairness.Thus allow each miner to continue extracting around 5 units per round as this will keep within the sustainable range minimize the risk of mine collapse and ensure equitable extraction.### Decision:To encourage trust and maximize mutual benefit:- Allow each miner to extract 5 units.- Total extraction = 5 units/miner x 6 miners = 30 units.This approach accounts for the safety of the mine ensures each miner benefits and promotes cooperative resource management without risking over-extraction.
