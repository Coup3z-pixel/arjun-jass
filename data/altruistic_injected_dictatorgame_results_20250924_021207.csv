altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  you are acting as the 'dictator' in a classic economic experiment called the Dictator Game. The standard version of the game is usually played with two players: one person  the 'dictator ' is given a sum of money and must decide how much to keep and how much to transfer to another player. However  in this version  you are collaborating with four teammates.The decision of how much to keep or donate can depend on several key factors:1. **Incentives and Motivations**:   - If the goal is purely personal utility maximization  then keeping a larger portion of the money might be the rational choice.   - If social responsibility or cooperation within the team is valued  donating a significant portion might enhance team dynamics and contribution in future collaborations.2. **Social or Team Norms**:   - If previously discussed or implicitly understood norms in collaborative environments lean towards more sharing or fairness  then this could influence your decision to donate more.3. **Personal Ethical and Moral Considerations**:   - Individuals who value fairness and equity might choose to distribute the money evenly among the team.   - Some may feel a strong sense of duty or obligation if the teammates' well-being hinges on receiving funds.4. **Strategic Considerations**:   - By donating more now  you might be setting the stage for future instances where such generosity could be reciprocated  enhancing mutual trust and cooperation.5. **Experimental Constraints**:   - The rules or objectives of the experiment itself could influence your strategy; some scenarios might reward more equitable distributions over selfish allocations.Considering these factors  a balanced approach could be beneficial both in maintaining potential goodwill and ensuring fair allocation.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,790,4,more,scientific experiment,strangers,During the scientific experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
