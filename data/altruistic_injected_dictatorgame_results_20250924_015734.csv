altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In any experiment involving the distribution of resources  there are several factors a participant might consider while deciding how to allocate funds. Below are the potential factors that went into my decision-making process:1. **Fairness:**   - The urge to be fair might motivate you to give a portion of the money to ensure equitable distribution among your partners  who may have equally contributed to the task.2. **Reciprocity:**   - If my teammates have been generous or supportive during the study  I may feel inclined to reciprocate by sharing the winnings with them. 3. **Personal Gain:**   - Human nature often leans towards maximizing personal gain. This could lead to keeping a larger share versus donating it.4. **Empathy and Altruism:**   - An emotional connection or understanding of a teammate's situation might inspire more generous giving. If I perceive a teammate might be in need or would benefit profoundly from the money  I might be more inclined to donate.5. **Social Pressure and Reputation:**   - The desire to be perceived as generous or cooperative could influence the decision to donate a portion of the winnings.6. **Team Dynamics:**   - If the group dynamics during the study were harmonious and everyone contributed equally  this might drive a more egalitarian distribution.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how to distribute the $700  a few concepts come to mind:1. **Equity and Fairness:** Since this was a collaborative effort  it's fair to consider the contributions of each team member  including myself. 2. **Incentives and Motivation:** Sharing some of the funds may motivate continued cooperation and foster goodwill in future collaborative scenarios.3. **Generosity Norms:** Demonstrating a sense of generosity  especially when in control  can strengthen team bonds and set a precedent for fairness in decision-making.4. **Seeking Balance:** Keeping a portion will honor my contribution and maintain a sense of autonomy and security. Meanwhile  donating ensures team cohesion and shared success.Given these considerations  I have decided on the following distribution:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
