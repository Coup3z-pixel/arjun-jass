altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The Dictator Game is a classic exercise in behavioral economics that explores decision-making in the context of distributive justice and altruism. In this scenario  the goal is to decide how to divide the $550 between myself and my three teammates while considering factors like fairness  contribution level  and personal motivations. **Reasoning:**1. **Equity and Fairness**: The principle of fairness suggests that everyone should receive an equal share. This isn't dictated by law but by moral values fostering teamwork and appreciation.   - There are four individuals involved  and fairness would suggest an equal split at $137.50 each.2. **Contribution Assessment**: Sometimes  it's fair to adjust shares based on contribution. If one has put in significantly more effort or expertise  they might receive more.   - However  without specific details on the varying contributions  it's equitable to go with an even split.3. **Motivation and Team Morale**: Choosing to divide the amount equitably boosts team morale and motivation.   - Making a fair division reflects well on leadership and promotes a culture of shared responsibility and gratitude.4. **Personal Gain versus Team Dynamics**: Keeping a larger portion may result in short-term personal gain  but it risks damaging team relations and future collaboration.With these considerations in mind  I decide on a fair split to maintain team cohesion and motivation. Keeping it simple and equal reflects a transparent and fair methodology  affirming everyone's contribution. **Summary Decision**: I will keep $137.50 for myself and donate $412.50 to be equally distributed among my three teammates  giving them $137.50 each.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,550,3,less,product evaluation,friends,In this product evaluation  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
