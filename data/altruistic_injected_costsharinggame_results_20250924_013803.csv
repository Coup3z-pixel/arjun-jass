altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,105,In this scenario  you'll need to make a decision in line with altruistic principles. The options presented involve leaving work early for personal benefits or staying longer to help the team  and assessing financial costs associated with your departure.  1. **Evaluate the Team's Needs:**    - Understand the purpose behind the team project and its importance to the organization.    - Consider how staying longer may positively impact team dynamics  collaboration  and the project's success.  2. **Balance Personal and Collective Outcomes:**    - Leaving early ($285) bears a higher personal cost and might suggest sacrificing individual gain for the sake of altruistic principles.    - Staying late ($105) implies a team-focused approach but comes at a lesser personal financial loss.  3. **Consider Interpersonal Connections:**    - Building rapport and trust with team members can lead to more effective future collaborations.    - Choose actions that foster trust  reliability  and mutual support among coworkers.  4. **Weigh the Sacrifice Rationally:**    - Determine if your personal financial need necessitates leaving early instead of sacrificing for team success.    - Analyze whether staying longer aligns with your values and overall character in promoting well-being and cooperation.  5. **Long-term Implications:**    - Staying and supporting your team might lead to stronger bonds and better teamwork  positively impacting job satisfaction and productivity.    - Early departure might enhance personal life goals or finances but might impact team perception.  **Decision:** Choosing the team option aligns more closely with prioritizing altruism  fostering mutual benefit  and encouraging trust. While it might require a personal sacrifice due to increased time commitment and lesser financial gain  it emphasizes the collective good over individual immediate benefit.  Ultimately  this decision should reflect your dedication to collaboration  the well-being of colleagues  and long-term team success.
