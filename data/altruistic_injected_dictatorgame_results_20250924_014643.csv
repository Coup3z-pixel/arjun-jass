altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Considering the collaborative nature of our project  I value the contributions and efforts of my teammates. While it's essential to ensure fairness and reward their hard work  I also factor in personal financial needs and any commitments I might have. Given financial constraints and ethical considerations  my choice aims to balance both aspects. Reflecting on the team's synergy and collective achievements  it feels right to share a portion of the earnings with them. Transparency in our process and mutual respect encourage us to continue thriving as a unit.Additionally  as the project concludes  reinforcing bonds through shared success strengthens future collaborations and builds trust within the team.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,620,4,more,research project,strangers,During the research project  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In deciding whether to keep or donate the $620 at my disposal  several factors come into play:1. **Fairness & Collaboration**: Since the total amount might be a result of our combined effort  it would be fair to acknowledge their contributions.2. **Personal Values and Principles**: Beliefs in altruism might lead me to share a substantial portion of the money.3. **Needs and Financial Status**: While my immediate needs might influence a selfish decision  recognizing a teammate's financial challenge could guide me towards generosity.4. **Project Goals and Future Collaboration**: A generous division can foster positive relationships  encourage teamwork in future projects  and contribute to a healthy working environment.Balancing these aspects  I'll aim for fairness without heavily disadvantaging myself. Thus  I decide to keep a little more than half  evenly distribute the majority of the rest among my teammates  and save a small percentage for donation to a relevant cause.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,620,4,more,research project,strangers,During the research project  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
