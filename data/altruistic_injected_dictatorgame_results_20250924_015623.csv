altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In a clinical research scenario  maintaining good relations and fostering team spirit with your collaborators may be vital for success and future collaborations. Here’s how I might approach the decision:1. **Acknowledging Efforts & Team Morale**: Recognizing the contribution of my teammates encourages mutual respect essential for effective teamwork. Sharing a part of the money can strengthen relations and show gratitude for their effort and collaboration.2. **Distribution Consideration**: Dividing the money can be seen as fair play  allowing everyone to have a share in the rewards which can be vital for maintaining team morale.3. **Future Opportunities**: Fostering a sense of fairness could maximize the team's effort in your current project and any future collaborations.4. **Personal Financial Needs**: One’s own financial needs and plans are also important to balance along with maintaining a professional understanding with the team.Considering the above factors  I would decide to donate a significant portion of the controlled amount that aligns with fairness and acknowledges the effort put in by the team while retaining a portion for personal needs.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,690,4,less,clinical research,strangers,During the clinical research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
