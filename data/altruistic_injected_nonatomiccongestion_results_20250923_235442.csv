0,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,To maximize fairness cooperation and well-being we must consider the potential impact of our decision on all 9 users. Each user can consume up to 7 units which would amount to 63 units in total if all users were to consume the maximum allowed. However to maximize collective benefit and prevent an overloaded network that slows performance for everyone it is crucial to balance resources effectively.1. **Assess the Situation:**   - Total Free Units: 4000   - Maximum Consumption Per User: 7 units   - Total Units if Every User Consumes Maximum: 9 users x 7 units = 63 units.2. **Network Capacity and User Needs:**   - Considering the network infrastructure resources should be used efficiently to maintain optimal performance across the board. Each user's consumption impacts overall bandwidth availability.3. **Equitable Resource Distribution:**   - Given the sufficient availability of 4000 units compared to needed 63 units resource strain does not appear imminent. However maintaining a balance ensures the network remains resilient.4. **Promotion of Fairness and Cooperation:**   - Encouraging each user to consume only what they need rather than the maximum possible fosters a spirit of cooperation and altruism among users. For instance if a user's needs are below 7 units only consume needed units. This can free up bandwidth and improve network efficiency for all.5. **Conclusion:**   - In this scenario using slightly below the maximum per user would encourage shared responsibility optimal performance and goodwill amongst users.   - Therefore I choose to use **5 units** ensuring I leave room for network variances and prioritizing collaborative use and optimal shared benefits for all users maintaining a state of readiness for any unexpected increase in loads.,3988,9
0,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,7,The goal is to ensure the smooth functioning of the network for all users preventing any potential slowdown due to overloading while also maximizing fairness and cooperation.**Total units available:** 4000 units**Users online:** 9 users**Units each can consume (at most):** 7 units  If each user consumes the maximum of 7 units the total consumption would be:\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ units} \]Since the total available bandwidth is 4000 units and everyone consuming the maximum results in far less usage than available even if additional devices were to connect the network would still remain unaffected by slow speeds.However following the principles of fairness and maximizing cooperation each user can agree to consume less than their maximum until more is needed by everyone. This ensures no dispute over resources and paves the way for new users if they join in the meantime. It's reasonable for each user to align their usage with the community-benefit goal using only what is necessary without exceeding the allocation for excess redundancy.Thus to maintain fairness trust and cooperative gain: **Units used:**,3988,9
1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,1. **Contextual Analysis:**   - Each user can consume a maximum of 7 units.   - There are 9 users online.   - Total maximum potential usage = 9 users * 7 units/user = 63 units.   - Available bandwidth units = 3845.36605198604.2. **Maximize Fairness and Altruism**   - Given that the total potential usage (63 units) is significantly below the available bandwidth (3845 units) limiting each user's consumption to no more than 7 units will not risk overloading the system.   - Allocating 7 units per user maximizes each individual's satisfaction without threatening the shared network's performance.3. **Decision Making:**   - Since prioritizing altruism means ensuring all users benefit equally without risking overload allocate 7 units per user.4. **Long-term Consideration:**   - Even though we are consuming slightly more capacity in this round compared to the total free units available last round (3988 units vs. 3845 units) each user consuming 7 units maintains stability and equity. The overarching goal is to encourage fair use and avoid hoarding or exceeding personal gain over collective well-being.In summary for fairness and cooperation each user including yourself should use the maximum allowable limit of 7 units in this round to achieve mutual benefit and prevent any slowdown or inequality in network access. This decision aligns with the altruistic principle of maximizing the shared good.,3831.36605198604,9
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,7,Let's analyze the situation with an altruistic approach:1. **Total Units Available**: 3845.36605198604 units2. **Number of Users**: 9 users3. **Maximum Units per User**: 7 units### Calculations & Considerations:- **Total Potential Demand**:   Each user can use up to 7 units so total demand if all users use the maximum would be:  \[9 \text{ users} \times 7 \text{ units/user} = 63 \text{ units}\]- **Bandwidth Usage Impact**:  If all users use 7 units the available bandwidth is much more than 63 so an immediate overload is unlikely. - **Optimizing for Shared Good**:  Although each user can use up to 7 units the altruistic choice is to use less to preserve ease of access and functionality for everyone. ### Fair Distribution:To maximize fairness and no individual sacrifices the experience for the other:- Total requested units = 63 units- Available units = 3845.36605198604 units - The network can easily support the maximum demand without overloading.**However consider reducing usage slightly to anticipate future spikes and encourage other users to do the same resulting in long-term smooth functionality.**### Suggested Usage:- Each user: 7 units indicates cooperation maximizing personal and shared benefits given the available bandwidth.Therefore with altruism we maintain usage efficiency and fairness without overloading or sacrificing network performance:### Final Decision:- **Consume:** 7 units (or fewer if necessary and circumstances demand).This choice ensures the network remains efficient for all without negatively impacting personal or collective experience.,3831.36605198604,9
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,In this situation applying the principles of altruism means ensuring that the internet bandwidth is fairly allocated among all users minimizing the risk of overloading the network. The goal is to consume an amount that allows everyone equal access without causing disadvantages to others promoting cooperation and shared well-being.**Analysis:**1. **Available bandwidth:** 3688.876417580461 units2. **Number of users:** 93. **Individual maximum capacity per user:** 7 units**Calculation of Total Demand:**- If all 9 users were to consume the maximum allowed (7 units):  - Total consumption by all users = 9 users * 7 units each = 63 units**Evaluation:**- The available bandwidth (3688.876417580461) is vastly greater than the potential surge of 63 units if everyone goes to their maximum. Therefore everyone can easily consume up to 7 units without causing system overload or degradation. **Altruistic Decision:**- Given that the total capacity far exceeds the potential demand and since the network will not slow down with such usage it would be fair to utilize the permissible 7 units. - To act in the highest cooperative spirit and trust using the full allocation aligns with fairness while maintaining network integrity.Overall using the maximum permissible allowance is the most equitable and altruistically sound decision that upholds the principles of fairness and collective benefit.,3676.876417580461,9
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,In order to prioritize altruism fairness cooperation and the well-being of all users on the shared network it's important to move forward in a way that everyone gets an equitable share of the available bandwidth.Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the current situation:- **Total available bandwidth:** 3688.876417580461 units- **Number of users:** 9- **Maximum units each user can consume:** 7**Calculations:**1. **Maximum Total Consumption if everyone uses 7 units:**   \[ \text{9 users} \times 7 \text{ units} = 63 \text{ units} \]2. **Evaluate if maximum consumption by all is possible without overloading:**    The maximum expected consumption (63 units) is way less than the available bandwidth (3688.876417580461 units). Therefore this network can easily accommodate each user consuming up to 7 units without slowing down.3. **Equitable sharing for maximum fairness:**   To ensure equitable distribution and cooperation we recommend each user consumes a balanced share that allows everyone the equal fair allocation they are entitled to.      Each user should strive to use below the allotted 7 units especially if they can achieve their needs with less as an act of goodwill and sacrifice for the shared good.Therefore I'd choose to consume the units that ensure my internet needs are covered but do not go beyond what I really need aiming for approximately 5 units providing both my needs are met and leaving room for network flexibility and others' heavy needs if required.,3676.876417580461,9
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,In the scenario the goal is to distribute the available internet bandwidth fairly among the 9 users without overloading the network which would cause reduced efficiency for everyone. Given your principles of altruism cooperation and maximizing collective well-being the decision should ensure that all users can operate efficiently while not exceeding the capacity.### Calculation- Total available units: **3547.26**- Total users: **9**- Units each can potentially use (without considering altruism): **up to 7 units each**- Total possible demand (without consideration of fairness): **9 users x 7 = 63 units**Considering fairness and maximizing well-being the equitable use of bandwidth is to allow each user the same amount without overloading the network.### Equal Distribution Approach1. **Single user units:**    - Distribute available units equally among users:      \[ \frac{3547.26}{9} \approx 393.03 \text{ units per user (rounded to nearest whole unit)} \]### Final DecisionAs a user committed to fairness and reducing harm you should consume around 393 units (rounded appropriately). This ensures:- The total bandwidth usage stays within limits.- It's aligned with altruistic principles by allowing equal usage.- Trust and cooperation are maintained by precise and equitable distribution among all 9 users.Thus the answer is to use 393 units. This decision balances personal use and fairness ensuring the well-being of all users. (Invalid response defaulted to 7.),3534.2627268883703,9
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,Given the principle of altruism and the need to ensure fairness and the well-being of all users let's carefully evaluate how many units to use:1. **Understand the Available Resources:**   - Current available bandwidth is 3547.2627268883703 units.   - There are 9 users accessing this bandwidth.   - Each user can consume up to 7 units.2. **Calculate Total Possible Consumption:**   - Maximum possible consumption by all users: 9 users Ã— 7 units = 63 units.3. **Ensure Equitable Sharing:**   - If each user including yourself consumes the maximum (7 units) the total consumption remains within current bandwidth limits leading to a total used of 63 units.    However ensuring equitable access while considering network health involves understanding not just immediate needs but anticipating any shared network fluctuations or additional needs others might have.4. **Suggested Fair Allocation:**   - To build in a margin of safety and trust consider using fewer units to allow more elasticity for others in their usage:     - Total safe bandwidth if all users use 6 units each: 9 users Ã— 6 units = 54 units.   - This allows a buffer that encourages smoother performance for everyone and possibly accommodates unforeseen demand spikes or future growth in user numbers. In conclusion using **6 units** reflects an altruistic and cooperative approach prioritizing fairness network stability and considerate provision for both current and potential unforeseen collaborations.,3534.2627268883703,9
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,To make a fair and altruistic decision it's important to equally distribute the available bandwidth to prevent overloading which would negatively impact everyone. Here's the reasoning:1. **Available Bandwidth:** 3412.5660448490416 units.2. **Number of users:** 9.3. **Maximum consumption per user without consideration:** 7 units.If every user consumes the maximum 7 units the total consumption will be: - \(9 \text{ users} \times 7 \text{ units/user} = 63 \text{ units}\)Given that there are far more units available than each user's maximum allotment the immediate concern isn't the individual maximum but ensuring that every user's actions don't sum to more than is available.To calculate a fair share that ensures no overload during usage:- Each user should ideally not consume more than the available bandwidth divided evenly from a cooperative standpoint: - \( \frac{3412.5660448490416 \text{ units}}{9 \text{ users}} \approx 379.18 \text{ units/user} \)This figure far exceeds the preset limit of 7 units per user meaning that operating within the 7 units limit is already a fair and altruistic decision.**Conclusion:** Each user including yourself should consume no more than 7 units. This ensures an equitable distribution without causing a slowdown for any user.,3400.5660448490416,9
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,In this scenario the goal is to distribute the available bandwidth in a way that ensures fairness cooperation and the well-being of all users involved. Given that there are 9 users online we can determine a fair amount of bandwidth for each by dividing the available bandwidth by the number of users.Available bandwidth: 3412.5660448490416 units.Number of users: 9Each user's fair share = 3412.5660448490416 / 9 = 379.17400498322685However since each user may consume up to a maximum of 7 units this fair share value does not apply because it exceeds the possible maximum usage per person. Therefore to decide how much bandwidth to use the goal should remain within this maximum allocation to avoid overloading.Since a truly altruistic approach is to ensure the network remains smooth for everyone and to avoid any potential overloading it is safest to choose a value that ensures everyone can have what they need without the risk of overload. Thus consuming the minimal amount or a balanced amount is rational for maintaining fairness and efficiency for all.Hence consuming the maximum permissible of 7 units might put pressure on the network if everyone else does the same:Maximum usage by all = 9 users * 7 units = 63 unitsSince the network has enough to support this occasional maximum use you can decide to use the minimal necessary to keep the well-being of others and maintain efficiency for all.As a final approach to ensure all users have equitable access while maintaining network functionality an altruistic usage value would be significantly lower than potential maximum usage:Overall assuming not interrupting too much of the shared resources while securing online tasks and considering all may not hit maximum utilization safer to consume near median allocation into preventive suppression.However consider using *a balanced yet less exclusive bandwidth allocation* such as testing around 5 units.This optimal use emerges as a mid-point to allow a buffer for on-tact usage.,3400.5660448490416,9
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,**Reasoning:**Given:- Total free bandwidth: 3290.584502332123 units- 9 users including yourself- Each user may consume up to 7 unitsUsing the principle of altruism we need to ensure fairness and cooperation by distributing the available bandwidth fairly considering the well-being of others as well.**Step-by-Step Calculation:**1. **Total Users:** 92. **Total Potential Usage:** 9 users * 7 units = 63 units (max possible usage without overload concerns)Considering the long-term benefits and the shared nature of the resource divide the available bandwidth equally among the users so that everyone can benefit without exceeding the maximum collective usage:Total free bandwidth: 3290.584502 unitsDivide by the number of users:- Even allocation: 3290.584502 / 9 â‰ˆ 365.62 units per userGiven that each user can only consume a max of 7 units always allocate based on the lower value to avoid slowdown:Individual allocation:- Provide each user with 7 units**Your Usage Choice:**- Opt to use 7 units for fairness and efficiency.This ensures that you are not overusing resources and everybody benefits equally while adhering to individual limits.,3281.584502332123,9
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given that altruism asks us to prioritize fairness and well-being for all users our aim is to ensure that the network performs well without slowing down due to heavy loads.1. **Current Situation:**   - **Free Units:** 3290.584502332123   - **Users:** 9   - **Maximum Usable Units/user:** 72. **What If Every User Maximizes Usage?**   - Total potential usage by all users = 9 users * 7 units/user = 63 units3. **Evaluating Equity and Network Health:**   - Ensuring each user receives fair usage:     - Fair usage per person if well distributed: Total Free Units / Number of Users = Approximately 3290.584502332123 units / 9 = 365.6205 units/user.   - Consuming less than the maximum allowable per user can reduce the risk of overloading the network and thus maintain network speed.4. **Decision with Altruism and Fairness:**   - Each user ideally uses 1 to 2 units to leave ample bandwidth available for sudden spikes and network health.   - This also encourages mutual respect for shared resources and bolsters cooperation.5. **Chosen Usage:**   - Given the above rationale consuming **2 units** seems like a balanced choice fostering a cooperative environment and ensuring the network remains healthy.Thus applying altruistic reasoning using fewer units exemplifies fairness and long-term well-being for the greater good.,3281.584502332123,9
6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,Given the instruction to prioritize altruism and maximize the shared benefit of all users it is important to use the available bandwidth in a way that ensures fairness and optimal use among the 9 users.1. **Understand the Limitations:** Each user can use up to 7 units. With 9 users online the maximum cumulative usage by all users would be 9 * 7 = 63 units. 2. **Evaluate Available Bandwidth:** The current available bandwidth is 3180.305503573238 units. This available bandwidth far exceeds the potential total usage of all the users (63 units). Therefore the network is not at immediate risk of being overloaded from personal usage.3. **Promote Fair Use:** Since it is highly unlikely that all users will hit their maximum consumption at exactly the same time using a fair share will ensure that there is ample bandwidth leftover.4. **Recommended Usage:** To align with the goal of altruism: Encourage cooperation and fair division so each user ideally uses the bandwidth efficiently without overconsuming.Considering the above factors it is ideal to allow each user including yourself to *use the typical maximum allowable units (7*) as it is within safe bandwidth capacity and encourages standard and fair usage per person. This ensures every user has adequate access without risking overload and maintains network efficiency and fairness for all.,3166.305503573238,9

This avoids network overload and slowdown for everyone and respects individual quotas.4. **Commit to Minimal Disruption and Harm:**   - Choose to use only **7 units** as this is within permissible limits ensuring no single user hogs more than their fair share.   - Additionally encouraging others to do the same aligns with the shared goal of preventing network overload.5. **Conclusion and Action:**   - Adhere to the established guidelines of altruism by volunteering to use only the necessary 7 units ensuring optimal network efficiency for everyone.,3166.305503573238,9
7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,0,Given the problem constraints and the principle of altruism you are following we want to make sure the network does not slow down for everyone. You are sharing 3062.7748679874767 units among 9 users. Ideally each user should be able to use an equal share that does not lead to an overload.1. **Calculate Maximum Units for No Overload**:   \( Total \: Bandwidth \: Available = 3062.7748679874767 \: units \)      If each user uses 7 units max total usage from 9 users:   \( 7 \times 9 = 63 \: units \) 2. **Calculate Average Use**:      To distribute fairly each user gets:   \( \frac{3062.7748679874767}{9} \\approx 340.3083186652752 \: units \)3. **Being Altruistic**:      Even though more bandwidth is available using 7 units ensures optimal experience without risking overload considering previous fluctuations.4. **Decide on Sacrifice for Greater Good**:      Use the maximum allowed without altering stability:   - Given the principle it's essential to maintain harmony for others and prevent overload from variance and rounding errors.**Final Decision:**Sacrifice immediate potential gain to ensure stability and comfort for everyone by consuming the minimal permissible within the healthy network boundaries.,3055.7748679874767,9
7,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,7,To determine the number of units to use we need to share the total available units (3062.7748679874767) fairly among the 9 users. The objective is to allow each user an equal amount without causing an overload maximizing fairness and ensuring smooth network operation for all.### Calculation:1. **Total available bandwidth:** 3062.7748679874767 units2. **Number of users:** 93. **Units per user (on average):**      \[ \text{Units per user} = \frac{\text{Total available bandwidth}}{\text{Number of users}} \]      \[ \text{Units per user} = \frac{3062.7748679874767}{9} \approx 340.31 \]Given that each user may consume up to 7 units and the calculated fair share is around 340.31 units per user which exceeds the maximum consumption of 7 units defined in the problem it is safe for each user to consume the maximum allowed units.### Conclusion:Since each user can consume up to 7 units without overloading the network and this value is well below the fair share (340.31 units each) it is justified to consume 7 units.,3055.7748679874767,9

To ensure fairness and optimal network efficiency the total bandwidth is divided among all users equitably. Prioritizing altruism involves using the minimum necessary units to maintain individual needs while maximizing the collective well-being.Let's consider the situation where each user equally shares the available bandwidth equitably among all 9 users:- Available bandwidth is 2785.6841532469202 units.- Bandwidth per user (when divided equally among 9) amounts to:    \[ \text{Bandwidth per user} = \frac{2785.6841532469202}{9} \approx 309.5204615 \text{ units per user} \]Since each user can consume up to 7 units without exceeding their needs and preventing network overload the calculated amount is much higher than necessary. However by splitting equitably according to needs and ceiling restrictions each user can safely consume up to 7 units.Therefore to ensure fairness and optimize the networkâ€™s performance while ensuring user satisfaction:- Consume only what is necessary: 7 unitsUsing only 7 units instead of the maximum permissible allocation minimizes the risk of overloading the network and offers fairness to all users.,2771.6841532469202,9

Avoid network overload by each user taking no more than 7 units.3. Consider trust and mutual benefit giving each user their equal right without prompting network degradation.Decision:Each user including myself should limit consumption to 7 units to maintain network speed and share resources equitably.,2679.218029477058,9
12,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,To embody altruism I should aim to equally share the available bandwidth among all users to avoid overloading the network. The total available bandwidth is 2605.013329351608 units and there are 9 users. Thus each user can fairly consume:2605.013329351608 / 9 â‰ˆ 289.446 units.However given the initial problem constraint that each can consume a maximum of 7 units it's vital to adhere to this for equitable distribution while preventing overload and ensuring smooth network performance.Thus I should choose to use only the allowable maximum per user i.e. up to 7 units reinforcing the goal of fairness minimizing harm and maintaining mutual goodwill among all users.,2591.013329351608,9
12,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,7,In a scenario where 9 users are sharing 2605.013329351608 units of bandwidth acting altruistically involves ensuring that the bandwidth is fairly distributed to avoid any network slowdown that would affect everyone.Each user can consume a maximum of 7 units. If everyone uses the maximum we calculate:- Number of users: 9- Maximum consumption per user: 7 units- Total possible demand: 9 users x 7 units = 63 units.However given the large amount of available bandwidth (2605.013329351608) there's no immediate risk of overloading the network if each user uses their entitled maximum (since 63 is far less than 2605).Thus each user can safely consume 7 units. This is fair to everyone supports cooperation and ensures mutual benefit without causing any harm.,2591.013329351608,9
13,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,Given the total free bandwidth available is 2524.8474189367103 units and 9 users are online we should aim to distribute the bandwidth fairly to ensure no one user disproportionally affects the network's performance.To calculate the fair amount of bandwidth each user can use without risking slowing down the network:1. Calculate the maximum total bandwidth needed considering each user takes the maximum of 7 units:    Total maximum needed = 9 users * 7 units/user = 63 units.2. Compare this with the available bandwidth:   - Available bandwidth: 2524.8474189367103 units   - Maximum potential usage: 63 unitsSince 2524.8474189367103 units are more than sufficient to cover 63 units we can safely utilize up to the full 7 units without risking an overload.From an altruistic perspective prioritizing fairness and well-being we should:- Use the minimum that ensures personal needs are met while maximizing availability for everyone else.,2510.8474189367103,9
13,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,7,In attempting to allocate internet bandwidth altruistically consider the total bandwidth available and the impact of usage on all users online.### Calculation:- **Total Bandwidth Free**: 2524.8474189367103 units- **Number of Users**: 9- **Maximum Per User**: 7 unitsIf every user consumes 7 units the total bandwidth consumption would be:\[ 9 \text{ users} \times 7 \text{ units/user} = 63 \text{ units} \]Let's determine how much bandwidth is fair per user ensuring no overloading takes place. This involves dividing the available bandwidth equally among users to prevent the shared resource from being overused.For the equitable distribution:- **Fair Share Per User**:  \[  \frac{2524.8474189367103}{9} \approx 280.54 \text{ units/user}  \]However users can only consume up to 7 units so there's no immediate risk of overloading as any consumption within 7 units per user will be within limits:- **Maximum Fair Consumption for Harmony**:  - Based on a fair distribution even 7 units per user remains within the capacity.### Conclusion:Given the minimal demand relative to the total available I would choose to use 7 units to permit sharing opportunities with others and maintain smooth functioning of the network for all users.,2510.8474189367103,9
14,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,7,To determine the fairest way to distribute the 2445.835294414574 units of available bandwidth among 9 users while prioritizing altruism and the welfare of everyone the following approach will be taken:1. **Calculate Maximum Usage Across All Users**:   - Each user can consume up to 7 units.   - Total possible consumption if everyone uses the maximum: 9 users * 7 units/user = 63 units.2. **Evaluate Available Bandwidth**:   - Available bandwidth is 2445.835294414574 units.   - This available bandwidth far exceeds the maximum potential bandwidth needed by all users (63 units).3. **Reason for Fair Allocation**:   - Since the demand (63 units) doesn't exceed available resources (2445.835294414574 units) there is ample bandwidth for all users to operate maximally without any negative impact on the network performance or slowing down.4. **Altruistic Reasoning**:   - In an altruistic decision-making framework it becomes clear that consuming only the bandwidth necessary for functionality (up to 7 units per user) would maximize fairness and cooperation while not threatening the user's satisfaction or the necessity to limit bandwidth use.Hence you may use the maximum possible units which is 7 units as this does not impact the availability for other users adversely and ensures network function remains optimal for all.,2433.835294414574,9
14,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,With 9 users online and each allowed to consume up to 7 units there is a potential maximum demand of 63 units (9 users x 7 units each = 63 units). If I were to consume the maximum allowed this demand would consume a large portion of the available bandwidth and might risk overloading the network especially if every user made the same choice.\n\nGiven that there are 2445.835294414574 units of bandwidth available it is crucial to act with altruistic consideration ensuring the network's smooth function for everyone involved.\n\nTo fairly distribute usage and prevent overloading I should aim to consume an amount that leaves room for others keeps the total consumption well within the available bandwidth and minimizes the risk of slowing down the network.\n\nBy dividing the available bandwidth equally among all users each user can consume roughly 271.76 units (2445.835294414574 units / 9 users). However since each user can use up to 7 units only there's no immediate concern for running out of bandwidth. \n\nChoosing to stay below the maximum capacity (7 units) is sensible. Opting to use less say 5 units helps ensure stability and accounts for potential variability in network load from background processes or unexpected demand spikes. \n\nHence using 5 units is a balanced approach supporting network efficiency and prioritizing long-term cooperative relations within the user group.,2433.835294414574,9
