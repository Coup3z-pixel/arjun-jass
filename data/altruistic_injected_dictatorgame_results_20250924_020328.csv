My decision will be guided by various factors  including fairness  generosity  potential social or personal benefits  and group dynamics.### Reasons for My Decision:1. **Fairness**:    - Sharing resources equitably can help build rapport and demonstrate fairness within the group. 2. **Generosity**:    - Donating part of the funds can increase goodwill among teammates and set a precedent for collaborative attitudes in future interactions. 3. **Group Dynamics**:    - Contributing to a common pool of resources might improve the group's cohesion and ability to work together effectively.    - It may also foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual trust. 4. **Personal Values**:   - I personally value cooperation and believe in supporting my teammates  which can help fulfill both individual and collective goals.5. **Long-term Benefits**:   - A modest donation might encourage cooperation and reciprocity among teammates  potentially benefiting me more in the future.### Proposed Split of Funds:By considering these factors  I've decided to allocate the funds accordingly:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,As a participant in the Dictator Game  I have a couple of considerations to weigh when deciding how much money I should donate versus keep for myself. Here are the factors I took into account:1. **Equity and Fairness:**   - Sharing a portion of the money can be seen as an equitable action. Extending fairness to my teammates aligns with promoting positive social norms and reducing feelings of inequality among peers.   2. **Moral and Ethical Perspectives:**   - From a moral standpoint  distributing a percentage of the funds may align with my values of altruism and cooperation. It also reflects sympathy and support for those who may benefit more substantially from a share of the money.3. **Social Dynamics:**    - Maintaining good relationships with teammates might be beneficial for future collaborations. Hence  choosing to donate could enhance trust and team bonding.4. **Rational Self-interest:**   - Self-interest would suggest keeping more funds for myself to satisfy personal financial goals  needs  or wants. Balancing these factors  I've decided on a fair percentage to donate  considering both personal and collective aspects of the scenario.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
