altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the Dictator Game  one player (the dictator) decides how to split a sum of money between themselves and another player. From a purely self-interested economic perspective  the dictator should keep all the money. However  many dictators choose to donate a portion of the money due to other social and psychological factors  such as fairness  empathy  or reputation.Given I collaborated with four teammates during the data modeling  it is essential to weigh both the economic and social implications of my decision:1. **Fairness & Collaboration Reward**: Our project's success was a team effort  and sharing part of the funds recognizes each member's contribution.2. **Maintaining Positive Relationships**: Demonstrating generosity can enhance team cohesion and morale.3. **Personal Financial Goals**: Considering upcoming personal expenses or financial goals can impact how much I decide to keep.4. **Anonymous Nature of Decision**: If the decision is not revealed to others  it might lead to keeping more.Taking these factors into account  I'll strike a balance between fairness and personal benefit.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,660,4,less,data modeling,strangers,During the data modeling  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
