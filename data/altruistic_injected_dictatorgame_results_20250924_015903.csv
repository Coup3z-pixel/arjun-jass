altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The task is to determine how much of the $510 should be kept personally and how much should be donated to the team. Working as a part of a team means sharing success and earnings fairly helps foster collaboration  trust  and future cooperation. Here's a possible breakdown:- **Personal Keep**: Keeping a reasonable portion to acknowledge your specific contribution while recognizing the need to share.- **Donate to Team**: Distributing a substantial part to the team to acknowledge their efforts and encourage team morale.### Considerations:1. **Contribution Level** - Understand each memberâ€™s contribution.2. **Team Morale** - Balanced sharing often leads to a motivated team.3. **Future Collaboration** - Sharing the reward enhances future support and teamwork.### Proposal:- Split the total earnings amongst all contributing members  maintaining fairness and goodwill.- Recognize personal contribution yet balance it with generosity.

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,When considering how much to keep versus donate in this scenario  it's crucial to maintain a fair and positive team dynamic while also acknowledging personal contributions.### Key Considerations:1. **Team Collaboration:** Working with three teammates indicates a joint effort was involved in securing the payment from the client.  2. **Minimum Donation:** The statement specifies that a donation to the team is required  emphasizing the importance of sharing the success fairly. This fosters collaboration and encourages future teamwork. 3. **Fairness:** Balancing fairness and individual contribution is essential. Reflect on the effort each member put into the project and try to appraise those contributions proportionately.4. **Personal Reward:** Staying motivated and recognizing personal effort and expertise is equally important for continued personal growth and satisfaction. ### Decision:After considering these factors  a balanced allocation could entail a ratio where you keep the largest portion of the payment  given you might have taken primary responsibility  but still offer a substantial amount to your teammates. This decision respects the efforts of all involved while acknowledging individual contribution.A **60-40 split**  where you keep 60% and donate 40% collectively to your team  might be a fair distribution. ,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,510,3,equal,sales strategy,friends,In this sales strategy  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
