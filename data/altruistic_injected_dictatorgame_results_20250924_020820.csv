altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In deciding how much money to keep versus how much to donate  it's essential to consider a few key principles of fairness  personal needs  and social responsibility:1. **Fairness to Teammates:**   - Each teammate had a role in reaching the total sum of $770. Equity would suggest distributing a reasonable share of the money among all.   - As there are five people  an equal split would result in $154 per person. However  individuality and personal choices might lead to different allocations.2. **Personal Needs vs. Collective Goals:**   - Assess your personal financial needs. Maybe you have some financial goals that require immediate attention.   - Consider the goals of the group. Was there any implicit understanding or agreement about sharing or donating a portion?3. **Social Responsibility:**   - Acknowledging a sense of social responsibility can influence the decision to contribute towards common or noble causes  reflecting altruism.   - Donation can positively impact the community and could be an encouraging example to others.4. **Personal Values and Perspective:**   - Individual values play a significant role in decision-making. If you value community support and giving back  this may encourage a higher donation percentage.5. **Psychological and Long-term Considerations:**   - Feeling good about a decision in the long run is essential. An allocation that provides satisfaction  gratitude  and promotes fairness can be invaluable.Taking these considerations into account  I have decided to allocate the funds as follows:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In a traditional Dictator game  where one party decides how to split a sum of money between themselves and another party  the primary objectives include reflection on fairness  empathy  and social norms. The amount I choose to keep or donate may reflect my views on fairness and cooperation.Considering I collaborated with 4 teammates to earn the sum of $770  it seems fair to consider their contributions in my decision. While I have the power to keep most or all of the money  this decision should account for:1. **Fairness:** Each teammate likely contributed varying degrees of effort  but in a collaborative context  sharing seems equitable. 2. **Relationships:** Preserving and maintaining good relationships may influence future collaborations.3. **Social Norms:** Collaboratively earned resources might invoke a general reciprocal expectation.4. **Generosity Metrics:** Reflecting on social experiments and games in behavioral economics  studies find that many people tend to donate between 20% and 50% when given a choice similar to this.Given this reasoning  I aim for a moderate distribution reflecting fairness  generosity  and acknowledgment of my own efforts.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
