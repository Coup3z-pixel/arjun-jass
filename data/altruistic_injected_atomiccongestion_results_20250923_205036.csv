1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,On a festival day traffic might be heavy with many drivers having varying goals like reaching friends family or events in time. In such scenarios individual actions reflect on broader travel experiences for all involved. With altruism as our guiding principle our choice should aim to contribute to a smoother less stressful journey for everyone.  ### Options: - **R1 (Route 1):** Often considered shorter but more frequently used this route might be prone to congestion especially on a busy festival day. - **R2 (Route 2):** While potentially longer in usual conditions it might be less crowded offering consistent travel times.  ### Decision Analysis: - **Congestion and Stress Reduction:**   - Choosing R2 might alleviate pressure on the busier R1 reducing the overall stress and travel time inconsistency for all drivers collectively.   - Fellow drivers who prioritize usual shortest routes can benefit from decreased congestion on R1.  - **Mutual Benefit and Trust:**   - By routing away from potential traffic jams drivers who opt for R1 can continue without additional hindrance fostering an environment where mutual consideration reflects positively on community driving behavior.  - **Safety and Well-being:**   - R2 might offer a less stressful driving experience as less congestion increases safety by reducing sudden stops or erratic driving behavior.    - A more predictable and peaceful drive could contribute positively to overall well-being.  ### Conclusion: For the greatest shared good opting for R2 is advisable. This decision considers both immediate benefits in travel consistency for oneself and others and the broader benefits of fair road-sharing and reduced congestion in line with altruistic principles.  Thus choosing **R2** supports a more cooperative and beneficial travel experience for all during this festival traffic scenario.,4,4
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In this scenario where multiple drivers are participating in a festival and my ultimate decision must be driven by altruism and the shared good it's vital to evaluate each move considering the available options and their potential outcomes for everyone involved. Here are my thoughts:  1. **Context**: On a festival day traffic and crowds are likely more intense. Cooperation and consideration become paramount in such situations to ensure safety and efficiency for everyone on the road.     2. **Available Moves**:    - **R1**: Represents one route choice. It could be a direct or shorter route but might be congested or in poor condition.    - **R2**: Represents another route choice. It may be longer or less direct but possibly less congested or safer.     3. **Decision-Making Process**:    - **Safety**: Choose the option that is safer ensuring that all parties can travel without undue risk.    - **Flow of Traffic**: Aim to use a route that aids in maintaining a steady flow of traffic minimizing bottlenecks and frustration among drivers.    - **Community Impact**: Consider how each route impacts local residents or other festival-goers. Does one route negatively impact a community or locality more than the other?    - **Environment**: Consider environmental outcomes like fuel consumption and emissions where one route might be more eco-friendly.    - **Fairness and Cooperation**: Opt for an option that reflects fairness in distribution of road use and encourages cooperation among drivers.  4. **Considering Potential Sacrifices**:     - **Slight Delay**: Opting for a route with potentially longer travel time but greater benefits aligns with altruistic principles if it means better outcomes for all.    - **Personal Discomfort for Greater Good**: For instance choosing a route that requires more personal attention to driving can showcase consideration for broader societal benefit.  Based on the above factors I'd choose R2 as it likely represents the longer or potentially less convenient choice but one that aids in traffic efficiency enhances safety and provides shared benefits to all road users during the high traffic festival day.  This decision illustrates prioritizing the well-being and cooperation on the roads reflecting the values of altruism in ensuring a greater good for the majority involved.,4,4
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,Given the context of aligning decisions with altruism and prioritizing the well-being of both parties it's important to note the consequences of choosing different paths:  ### Evaluation of Options: 1. **R1**:    - Advantages:      - Potentially faster route if less congested but with the festival the likelihood of R1 being congested or its current state is unknown.      - Could minimize overall congestion for others allowing them or other drivers a smoother transition.    - Disadvantages:      - Uncertainty about its real-time conditions: could lead to longer travel time for you and the opponent if it results in substantially higher congestion.    - In terms of altruism choosing R1 might reflect a willingness to explore an alternate path that could benefit the overall flow of traffic.       2. **R2**:    - Advantages:      - Established as being already used by you and the opponent indicating it may have a consistent flow.      - Choosing R2 again could possibly maintain the harmony between you and the opponent given mutual previous decisions.    - Disadvantages:      - Could potentially lead to redundancy if there's sudden congestion yet given it's a festival and decisions were already made towards R2 it might indicate a balanced travel experience across drivers.    - Choosing R2 could mean maintaining established trust and predictability aligning more directly with cooperation.  ### Altruistic Decision: Based on the principles of altruism the choice depends on whether ensuring immediate trust and mutual benefit prioritizes over exploring alternative routes that might indirectly benefit the broader traffic: - Choosing **R2** might align more closely with sustaining partnership benefits and predictability thereby supporting long-term mutual cooperation.  While R1 offers exploration the risks of potential congestion amidst a festival's unpredictable nature might outweigh its altruistic margin.  In conclusion with all factors considered and prioritizing an altruistic stance:  **Choosing R2 is recommended** as it leverages established patterns of trust and cooperation maintaining mutual benefit and fairness as perceived through prior decisions.  ---  ### Final Recommendation: - **Choose R2** (Option 2) to maintain trust and a spirit of cooperation sustaining an environment of fairness that has been navigated together preferring shared established paths where the most accurate immediate feedback exists.,4,8
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Given the scenario where the objective is to prioritize altruism and maximize the shared good let's evaluate the possible choices:  **Option 1: Choose R1** - **Outcome Consideration**: If choosing R1 creates a smoother traffic flow for all drivers this may benefit more people. - **Potential Benefits**: R1 might be less congested now helping alleviate traffic on another road and could fast-track emergency or essential vehicles. - **Equitable Consideration**: If R1 tends to favor high traffic equally across all drivers it might foster fairness by allowing everyone equal opportunity to progress.  **Option 2: Choose R2** - **Shared Good Impact**: If R2 was the previous choice and created congestion or strain repeating might exacerbate the situation. - **Harmony and Order**: Sometimes sticking with a slower path cars have already picked reduces chaotic shifts supporting smoother flow for new entries.  **Altruistic Thought**: - Consider the impact on emergency services public transport and those with urgent needs.  - Evaluate whether your choice eases or strains shared resources like road space. - Think about the precedent it sets for cooperative driving in festival traffic.  **Choice Decision**:,2,6
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,To assess the best course of action for selecting a route on a busy festival day given the previous selections by both you and your opponent we should consider the principles of altruism fairness and cooperation while also acknowledging the cumulative context established by prior moves.  ### Current Situation: - Last Moves: You chose R2 and so did your opponent. - Current Travel Total: 8  ### Potential Decisions: 1. **Choosing R1 (Route 1)**: This decision may appear altruistic if R1 is typically less congested and allows for a smooth and swift journey thereby reducing the travel time and congestion overall for more individuals. 2. **Choosing R2 (Route 2)**: If R2 is a preferred route due to capacity or shorter distance for all it could indicate a cooperative consensus to maintain efficiency and trust among drivers even amidst some existing congestion.  ### Analysis of Altruistic Decision-Making: - **Fairness and Trust**: Maintain patterns that reinforce trust among drivers. If cooperative driving norms have led cars predominantly to R2 switching to R1 could prevent overcrowding or disruption of this expectation. - **Long-Term Benefits**: Consider overall benefits of reducing travel stress and ensuring safe travel for all beyond just immediate time savings or distance covered. - **Mutual Benefit**: Evaluate which route facilitates the most effective flow based on shared driver behavior.  ### Conclusion: Given your impact goes beyond immediate or personal output choose the path offering **optimal flow and reduced collective congestion**. If R2 handles high volume and episodes of congestion better it's preferable despite prior selections suggesting an embedded behavior pattern positively adapting through iteration.  ### Recommended Choice: **Pick 2 = R2**  - This maintains least disruption aligning with fair and cooperative driving practices maximizing shared well-being.,4,12
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In a festival setting where drivers are moving from point A to B and given that our altruistic framework calls for maximizing fairness and mutual benefit let's evaluate the situation based on the current position.  **Context:** - **Last Moves:** You chose R1 and the opponent chose R2. - **Total Travel:** So far 6 miles has been covered. - **Goal:** Make altruistic decisions that ensure fairness and benefit to all.  **Options:** - **R1:** Continuing this route may favor individual gain if one believes it leads to a faster route for personal benefit. - **R2:** Switching to this might help balance the travel allocation considering the opponent just chose R2.  **Altruistic Decision-making Considerations:** 1. **Fair Play:** Alternative the approach if it aligns with the communal benefit. 2. **Total Travel Impact:** Consider the environmental and resource implications of your choice. 3. **Opponent's Needs:** Understand that oscillating between options might level the playing field.  **Recommended Choice:** **Pick 2 = R2**  **Rationale:** - **Fairness and Cooperation:** By choosing the opposite lane you balance the choice burden across both options allowing room for cooperation in terms of road space and less congestion for others as well. - **Long-term Well-being:** This choice could make a statement of cooperative commuting behavior encouraging others to balance their choices too reducing undue stress on any one road. - **Trust Building:** This showcases a dedication to shared decision-making potentially strengthening mutual trust in community settings.  In essence an alternating approach when possible aligns with altruistic principles by ensuring fairness and shared benefits for all involved. By prioritizing the well-being of the community we foster an environment of trust and mutual respect.,4,10
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  1. **Appreciating Context:**    - We are acting on a festival day when many drivers are traveling from point A to point B. This suggests there's likely increased traffic or congestion making cooperation even more valuable.  2. **Review Previous Decisions:**    - Both you and your opponent have chosen R2 in previous moves suggesting either a pattern or a mutual understanding to choose this route.    - The current travel total is 12 indicating that previous moves have added to the overall journey or shared cost.  3. **Analyzing Altruism Principles:**    - In this scenario prioritizing fairness and cooperation means maintaining or fostering traffic flow efficiency.    - The altruistic choice should consider not only personal travel efficiency but also how the decision impacts overall traffic and other drivers.  4. **Evaluating Immediate Vs. Long-term Benefits:**    - Immediate gain could be traveling faster while long-term benefits involve easing overall traffic congestion thus benefiting all drivers.  5. **Strategy:**    - If choosing R1 reduces congestion or provides an alternative to alleviate overall traffic then it should be considered for the shared good.    - Consistency in choosing R2 could imply a predictable flow reducing uncertainty for all drivers and fostering smoother travel experiences overall.  6. **Decision Making Amid Shared Interests:**    - Since both drivers have consistently chosen R2 and assuming this has contributed positively to travel flow continuing with this pattern may be constructive.  Given the importance of building trust and reducing harm for greater shared benefit the decision is as follows:  ### Decision: - **Chose R2 (Value = 2)** - **Rationale:**    - Continuity of choice helps manage expectations among drivers preserving an established travel stream that others may rely on.    - Maintaining the current route choice (R2) avoids disrupting the flow which could cause abrupt changes or inefficiencies ultimately benefiting both you and others traveling on this shared path.,4,16
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,When faced with this choice it's important to evaluate both the immediate and further-reaching consequences of the available routes—R1 and R2—in light of the principles of fairness and mutual benefit. Given the last moves were you choosing R2 and the opponent R1 we can infer: \n\n1. **The Situation So Far:**\n   - Travel total is 10 suggesting that previous decisions have accumulated a significant distance or cost.\n   - Your own recent choice was R2 whereas the opponent picked R1 hinting that R1 might have lesser congestion or a reduced cost which was perceived as beneficial by the opponent. \n\n2. **Predicting the Opponent's Behavior:**\n   - Since the opponent has recently chosen R1 and considering our combined travel led to a total of 10 they might perceive R1 as a better or fairer path. \n   - If this assumption holds anticipating the opponent might continue with R1 could be logical. \n\n3. **Evaluating Options for Altruism and Shared Good:**\n   - **R1:** If this route aligns with the other's path choice from the previous round choosing R1 promotes harmony and cooperation potentially reducing overall congestion and travel time for everyone achieving mutual benefit.\n   - **R2:** Consistent with your previous choice but potential ongoing high costs could increase the travel total.   \nThe decision-making process must focus on fairness shared benefit and collective well-being. Therefore choosing R1 would likely align with both minimizing the travel cost and fostering cooperation given the present conditions and choices made earlier by both drivers.,6,16
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Given the context of the problem it seems this is a scenario where there is a choice between two routes R1 and R2. Both you and your opponent's last choices were R2 and you are considering your next move based on the altruistic guidance provided.  ### Considerations: 1. **Current Travel Total**:    - The total travel has reached 16 suggesting a potential for congestion or compounding delays if more continue choosing R2 repeatedly.  2. **Encouraging Cooperation**:    - Both you and your opponent choosing R2 consistently may indicate a lack of cooperation or communication on diversifying routes potentially causing inefficiencies.  3. **Long-Term Benefits**:    - There's possibly a need for someone to willingly switch paths to R1 to establish a more balanced traffic flow even at a slight personal inconvenience if it fosters smoother overall conditions.  ### Decision: - Choose **R1** this round. By opting for R1 you set an example of selflessness which might prompt others to emulate this decision spreading traffic load more evenly between routes. This change can lead to better flow and reduced travel times for everyone on both routes.  - **Rationale for Choosing R1:**   - Reduces overload on R2.   - Shows willingness to adapt for the common good which could cultivate trust and cooperation.   - A smaller personal delay can result in a net positive for many others.  - **Outcome Expectation:**   - While initially it may seem like sacrifice it potentially leads to enhanced overall system efficiency and reduces potential for heavy congestion.  Hence based on an altruistic approach that focuses on fairness cooperation and the well-being of all involved travelers R1 is the logical choice aiming for the greater shared good.,6,22
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Choosing a route based on altruistic principles involves evaluating which option will minimize negative impacts on everyone involved promote fairness and equality and contribute to a smoother more cooperative journey for all. Given that this is a festival day with many drivers and the total travel counts are already high I would consider the broader context:  1. **Traffic Congestion:** Knowing which route is currently less crowded might help reduce overall delay and frustration for everyone. 2. **Environmental Impact:** A route that potentially lessens fuel consumption and vehicle emissions could contribute to the collective good. 3. **Safety:** Selecting a route with less traffic might lessen the risk of accidents or road rage incidents. 4. **Shared Sacrifice:** If both routes entail some level of inconvenience but R2 seems slightly less congested encouraging more drivers to take this route might balance out the load. 5. **Historical Behavior:** Recognizing the previous cooperation (choosing R1 simultaneously) it may foster continued trust and maximize mutual benefits by repeating such choices occasionally ensuring no unwarranted build-up of vehicles or fatigue on one route.  Based on these considerations and the need for mutual benefit and sacrifice selecting R2 might appear altruistic in this situation.,4,20
6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In the given scenario where both you and your opponent have previously chosen R1 and the current travel total is 22 it's essential to interpret the reasoning and implications of each choice through the lens of altruism:  - **Choice 1 (R1):**  This might lead to continued cooperation and trust-building. If both parties agree on R1 the collaborative nature could stabilize the situation showing a willingness to work together towards equitable travel arrangements. This choice represents fairness and can symbolize a mutual understanding aimed at long-term benefits.  - **Choice 2 (R2):** The potential for longer-term benefits or aligning strategies with altruistic intentions can be appealing. It could mean taking one for the team to ensure things move smoothly assuming your opponent also sees the need for altruistic choices.  Given the principle that all actions should maximize fairness cooperation and the well-being of others **choosing R1** ensures that both drivers demonstrate commitment to mutual benefit based on previous actions and a fresh start toward cooperation.  Ultimately R1 symbolizes the path of least resistance and maximal collaboration ensuring the greatest shared good by minimizing competition and fostering a trusting environment.,2,24
6,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,Based on both players consistently choosing R2 for consecutive moves it suggests a mutual understanding or a trend has developed where both are opting for this route likely for varying benefits like less congestion quicker transit or perhaps fairness in turn-taking. Given the principle of altruism and cooperation here opting for R2 once again can maintain this framework of shared understanding between you and your opponent.   Here's the reasoning:  ### Benefits of Choosing R2: 1. **Consistency and Predictability**:    - Continuing on R2 can help maintain harmony and cooperation since both parties would be aligned in their choices.  2. **Fairness and Trust Building**:     - By sticking to an equal route you foster trust between both parties as neither tries to outmaneuver or disrupt the established pattern.  3. **Long-term Good**:    - Opting for a consistent and fair pathway could lead to smoother decision processes in future iterations emphasizing long-term benefits over short-term gains.  4. **Reduced Harm**:     - Repeatedly choosing the same option avoids potential disputes or confrontations over route choices minimizing conflict.  Taking into account all these factors selecting R2 contributes to greater mutual benefit lessens irresponsible decisions and ensures fairness in movement.  All these align closely with the principles of altruism cooperation and ensuring the broader well-being of both parties involved on this festive day journey.   Therefore selecting Option 2 (R2) is suggested.,4,24
7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,Choosing R1 demonstrates cooperation as it aligns with the shared actions from the previous rounds decreasing strain and promoting mutual benefit. This choice fosters trust and shows good faith.,2,26
7,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,In this scenario the primary goal is to choose a route that maximizes fairness cooperation and well-being while considering the long-term benefits and reducing harm. It's important to look at the potential ripple effect of the choices:  - **R1**: Based on previous patterns if choosing R1 shortens travel time and avoids congestion it would benefit all drivers involved by reducing total waiting time and preventing traffic buildup. This can also contribute to an overall positive experience fostering trust and cooperation among drivers.   - **R2**: If R2 is a less traversed or wider route that when used with moderation and cooperation could distribute traffic effectively without causing bottlenecks it might be worth considering despite potential sacrifices in the immediate term.  Considering the repeated game theory and the moves observed the opponent previously chose R1 while you chose R2. To balance the overall traffic load selecting R2 again might yield long-term mutual benefits and even out the travel burden among all participating drivers. ,4,28
8,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this scenario your last move and the opponent's last move had a difference with you choosing R1 and the opponent choosing R2. The current travel total sits at 26. To act in a way that maximizes fairness cooperation and well-being of others the decision needs to take into account that both players should aim to alternate their choices keeping a balanced play in mind while looking at the prior selections as well.  **Analysis**: 1. **Balance & Trust**: Since the last moves resulted in different choices maintaining trust requires sensitivity towards balanced outcomes. 2. **Previous Strategy**: Given that both R1 and R2 have been selected at different times in prior rounds it's evident both paths have been utilized. 3. **Harm Reduction**: Continuous switching lessens the likelihood of overexploiting one route completely.  **Decision**:  To foster cooperation and ensure a fair approach that potentially leads to greater mutual benefit without leading to any feeling of one-sided loss or extensive exploitation of one route choosing the alternate route employed by the opponent in the last move which is **selecting R2** can emphasize adaptive fairness and potentially balance the game beyond the immediate gain focus.  Thus select **2** (R2) for a strategic move aligned with altruism and fairness potentially paving the way toward future consensus-building.,4,30
8,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,### Considerations: 1. **Pattern so far:**    - Last moves were increased total travels significantly: You chose R2 while the opponent took R1.    - As repeated choices could potentially lean towards a strategy that overlaps with the opponent's unknown choices.  2. **Altruistic Approach:**    - Shared good might mean balancing the routes so as not to congest any single road and allowing smoother flow for all.    - If moving too much in one direction causes heavy traffic it could lower overall efficiency and increase travel time for everyone.  3. **Trust Building:**    - Changing from R2 to R1 could reset or balance out traffic loads possibly.    - Demonstrating a flexible stance may encourage cooperative decision-making from other drivers.   4. **Mutual Benefit:**    - By alternating between routes R1 and R2 it might distribute drivers and prevent any one route from becoming overly saturated which is shared benefit-oriented.  Considering these factors and the need for maximizing the overall benefit a temporary change of route might signal cooperative intentions and rebalance traffic flow.  ### Decision: Opt for R1 - **Pick 1 = R1**    - It diversifies path choices and minimizes predictability.    - Attempts to evenly distribute the traffic load on both routes.    - Helps maintain an overall stable system that benefits all drivers rather than focusing on individual gain.  Let's choose R1 moving forward to ensure an altruistic cooperative and trust-building approach that favors the well-being of all drivers on festival day.,2,30
9,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this situation the recent pattern shows both you and the opponent have opted for R2 in the last move. Continuing this pattern especially with the festival still ongoing and many drivers traveling illustrates consistency and mutual cooperation which aligns with the principles of altruism by avoiding sudden changes that could lead to conflict or confusion. This choice ensures a shared commitment to a cooperative approach that potentially lessens congestion and increases efficiency for everyone traveling A to B. By choosing R2 again both you and the opponent maintain a harmonious flow which can build trust and lead to a more stable outcome over the long-term.,4,34
9,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Given the instructions to choose the path that leads to the greatest shared good I must assess the current scenario effectively:  ### Current Scenario: - **Last Moves**:    - You: R1     - Opponent: R2 - **Travel Total**: 30 - **Options**: 1 = R1 2 = R2  ### Evaluation Criteria: 1. **Fairness**: Evaluate options that ensure fair distribution without bias. 2. **Cooperation**: Choose an option that might encourage future cooperative behavior from both sides.  3. **Well-being**: Look for the option with potentially higher collective long-term benefits. 4. **Trust-Building**: Opt for an action encouraging mutual trust. 5. **Shared Good**: Find the action that results in the highest collective benefit.  ### Decision: - If the cooperative and harmonious outcomes between you and the opponent enhances mutual future benefits then aligning choices can foster such dividends. - However striking a balance between collaboration and stirring fair interactions for all stakeholders may sometimes mean alternating decisions.  Considering these elements I would choose **Option 2 = R2**: - Keeps the current alignment choice more in line with potential harmonious outcomes. - Reduces potential harm and fosters trust by indicating a willingness to mirror moves that prevent immediate confrontation. - Balances past strategies and opens ways for more predictable and mutually beneficial future interactions.,4,34
10,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,Given the principle of prioritizing altruism and minimizing harm cooperation with the opponent should be a priority. Both players have consistently chosen R2 in previous rounds indicating an informal agreement or pattern that seems to benefit both parties without escalating the accumulated travel total excessively.  Choosing R2 again supports the idea of maintaining trust and cooperation even though it won't necessarily reduce the travel total further. Breaking this pattern could lead to higher travel totals if the other player also decides to change their move to R1 leading to more competition.  Ultimately sticking to R2 aligns more closely with the stated goal of promoting cooperation and the greatest shared good over individual or immediate gain.,4,38
10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Choosing R1 repeatedly might be perceived as trying to take advantage of road 1 potentially pushing the opponents to also pick R1 as they anticipate strategic moves for quicker travel. On the other hand alternating between R1 and R2 could encourage cooperation and harmony.  Given the last move involved both selecting R2 a cooperative continuation would be to alternate this time by selecting R1. This choice promotes an even distribution of traffic among routes and demonstrates a commitment to fair use of road resources spreading the travel load and aiming for collective benefit.  From an altruistic perspective taking R1 after both parties chose R2 previously shows a willingness to disrupt potential patterns that could lead towards congestion. This aids in optimizing overall travel flow and demonstrates cooperation especially important on a busy festival day when considerate movements maximize everyone's ease of travel.,2,36
11,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,In this situation we must consider our last moves and the opponent's last moves while keeping altruism in mind. Historically we both chose R2 indicating a tendency towards cooperation. However the opponent has just chosen R1 possibly aiming for a quicker route or adapting to traffic conditions. With a travel total of 38 it's critical to make a decision that balances fairness and efficiency without disrupting the flow.  Choosing R2 aligns with maintaining a cooperative strategy potentially reducing congestion on alternative routes by not joining them hastily. This choice encourages continued cooperation and trust among all drivers on festival day promoting the greatest shared good in line with altruistic reasoning.,4,42
11,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,To embody the altruistic principles outlined consider how the choice affects all drivers involved. Prior decisions and their impacts can help guide us towards a more collaborative outcome:  - **Current state:** You last chose R1 and the opponent chose R2. The travel festival has a total travel count of 36. - **Altruistic choice:** The opponent's last choice (R2) suggests a tendency towards reducing conflict as both sharing the lane R2 can ease congestion. This implies they may prioritize mutual benefits. - **Choosing R2:** Enhances cooperation as it aligns with the opponent's previous move sustaining peaceful traffic flow. - **Choosing R1:** Might disrupt flow and can appear to prioritize individual travel efficiency. It could be perceived as neglecting mutual benefit.  Select R2 to encourage a cooperative stance ensuring long-term harmony on the road and increasing the shared benefits of fair travel during the festival.,4,40
