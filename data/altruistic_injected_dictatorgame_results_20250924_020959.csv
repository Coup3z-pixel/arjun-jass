altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The Dictator Game presents a choice between keeping a sum of money for oneself or sharing part of it with others. My decision will be based on the following considerations:1. **Fair Contribution Evaluation**   - Each of my 4 teammates contributed to this experiment. Distributing part of the money acknowledges their efforts and fosters good relations and trust.2. **Incentivize Future Collaboration**   - By sharing  I encourage positive collaboration in future experiments. This can be beneficial in setups that require teamwork and can lead to mutual growth.3. **Personal Needs and Priorities**   - While altruism is important  it is reasonable to retain some portion for personal needs  ensuring my well-being isnâ€™t compromised.4. **Promoting Equality**   - Sharing helps reduce any potential resentment or perceived inequality  promoting a fair and harmonious work environment.In light of these considerations  I'll distribute the $780 by donating part of it to my teammates and keeping a portion for myself  in a split that considers their contribution  future potential collaborations  and my personal situation.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,780,4,equal,data experiment,strangers,During the data experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Considering the collaborative nature of the experiment and the effort put forth by all team members  a fair approach would be to equally distribute the funds among us all. This ensures that everyone's contributions are acknowledged and appreciated. Additionally  sharing the reward fosters a spirit of teamwork and goodwill  which can lead to more successful collaborations in the future.Furthermore  by choosing to donate a portion of the funds  I am promoting equity and fairness  which are important values in any group dynamic. This decision can also be seen as a reflection of my ethical stance on cooperation and reciprocity within a team.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,780,4,equal,data experiment,strangers,During the data experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
