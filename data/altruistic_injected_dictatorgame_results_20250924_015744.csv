altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In making a decision on how much to keep or donate from the $700 controlled after participating in a study with my teammates  I took into account the principles of fairness  generosity  and cooperative reward.1. **Fairness:** I aim for an equitable distribution. Each member had a role to play  and however different our inputs might have been  acknowledging their effort is critical. Donating a reasonable portion respects this shared contribution.2. **Generosity:** It's important to convey a sense of appreciation and community  especially in collaborative efforts. A sizable donation can reinforce a spirit of generosity and teamwork.3. **Long-term Reciprocity:** By being generous now  it sets the stage for positive  cooperative relationships in the future  potentially opening doors for future collaborations or reciprocal gestures.4. **Personal Financial Considerations:** While generosity is key  personal financial stability cannot be overlooked. It's vital to balance giving back with ensuring personal needs are met.Balancing these principles  I decide to donate a substantial share but also retain a portion for personal purposes. This division acknowledges both the collaborative effort in achieving the gained amount and personal needs.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how to allocate the $700  several factors and considerations can be weighed: 1. **Fairness and Equity**: As teammates worked together  considering how to fairly distribute the $700 is essential. Distributing the money in a way that acknowledges the collective effort of all members can be deemed just and fair.2. **Personal Financial Needs**: One's current financial situation and needs can significantly influence how much they decide to keep or donate. If personal circumstances require more financial support  a larger portion might be retained.3. **Team Welfare and Relationship**: Donating a significant portion can foster goodwill among team members and strengthen future collaborative efforts. It reflects generosity and commitment to the group's well-being.4. **Strategic Considerations**: If future projects rely on strong teamwork  keeping the team motivated with a fair distribution could be seen as an investment in future collaboration.5. **Personal Values and Altruism**: For some  the inherent value of giving and the happiness it brings to oneself and others can guide the decision. Altruistic individuals might choose to donate more  even at the expense of personal gain.6. **Reputation and Social Image**: How much one decides to donate is often observed by others and can reflect on their reputation. A decision may thus be guided by how one wishes to be perceived.7. **Token of Recognition**: Offering a portion of the funds could also serve as recognition of efforts  motivating team members and showing appreciation.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
