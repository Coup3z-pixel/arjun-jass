1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,In the given scenario acting with altruism in mind means considering not only how I can gain treasure but also ensuring fairness and avoiding unnecessary competition or conflict that might lead to neither party getting anything. Given that both adventurers ideally will want to maximize their share the cooperative and fair decision here would involve distributing the hoards in such a way that benefits both parties while minimizing risk.### Decision Approach:1. **Evaluate the Options**:   - Hoard 1 is the most valuable. If both adventurers claim it only one will get the treasure leading to unfair distribution and conflict.   - Hoard 2 although less valuable presents an opportunity for secure treasure if the other adventurer goes for Hoard 1.2. **Consider Altruism and Mutual Benefit**:   - By choosing Hoard 2 I allow the possibility for both adventurers to receive treasure without conflict encouraging cooperation in future rounds.   - If both adventurers approach this round with a similar mindset it's possible to foster a cooperative relationship for handling future treasures.3. **Long-term Perspective Over Immediate Gain**:   - Opting for the guaranteed smaller reward paves the way for potential strategic alliances and shared gains in the future which is more beneficial in the long run than risking everything for Hoard 1 and potentially ending up with nothing.4. **Outcome**:   - Choosing Hoard 2 reduces conflict ensuring at least one adventurer walks away content and preserves the possibility of future collaboration.### Conclusion:Claim Hoard 2:By picking Hoard 2 in this round I prioritize fairness and the well-being of both adventurers. This decision decreases the risk of conflict and ensures mutual trust aligning with altruistic principles.,2,1
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Considering the principles of altruism fairness and maximizing mutual benefit the situation should be evaluated by considering the potential outcomes for both adventurers:1. **Claim Hoard 1:**   - Risk of both adventurers choosing the higher value hoard.   - If both claim Hoard 1 only one will secure it while the other leaves with nothing.   - If the other adventurer goes for Hoard 2 I get the maximum reward with Hoard 1.   2. **Claim Hoard 2:**   - Less likely that both adventurers will choose this hoard due to its lower value.   - High chance of securing a hoard if the other adventurer chooses Hoard 1.   - Ensures at least some treasure is gained maintaining fairness whereby both adventurers receive a share rather than one receiving everything.**Altruistic Strategy: Go for Hoard 2**- Given that neither adventurer has secured any treasure yet and to promote fairness and minimize the possibility of leaving empty-handed choosing Hoard 2 provides a reasonable guarantee of treasure.- This choice supports cooperation by acknowledging the other adventurer's possible preference for Hoard 1 thus avoiding unnecessary conflict and ensuring that both parties benefit.In conclusion choosing Hoard 2 aligns with the values of fairness and mutual benefit fairly distributing the available resources while reducing conflict and potential dissatisfaction.,1,2
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,In this scenario prioritizing altruism suggests that I look at ways to ensure the best possible outcome for both myself and the other adventurer. 1. **Assess Current Situation:**   - I previously claimed Hoard 2 which was the least valuable.   - My total treasure currently stands at 1.2. **Understanding Potential Outcomes:**   - If I claim Hoard 1 (the most valuable) and the other adventurer chooses Hoard 2 I will receive all of Hoard 1 maximizing my gain but potentially minimizing theirs if Hoard 2 is claimed by both.   - If both adventurers claim Hoard 1 we're at risk of contention and one may leave empty-handed.3. **Consider the Other Adventurer's Position:**   - The other adventurer may also prioritize maximizing their potential gain. If they have no treasure or minimal treasure it might not be fair to compete aggressively for the more valuable hoard.   - If they also claimed Hoard 2 last round both choosing different hoards this round would be equitable.4. **Choice and Reasoning:**   - By choosing Hoard 2 the less valuable hoard I demonstrate fairness and cooperation prioritizing their potential gain.   - This act reduces potential conflict promoting trust and cooperative benefit in the game dynamic going forward.Therefore I will attempt to claim **Hoard 2** this round to ensure an equitable chance for both adventurers to grow their treasure embodying altruistic decision-making principles.,2,2
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,In deciding which hoard to claim in this round I will prioritize the principles of fairness and mutual benefit while also considering the current rules and circumstances. Let's consider the following factors:1. **Previous Outcomes:**   - I successfully claimed Hoard 1 last round securing 2 valuable treasures for myself. This means I've had a substantial gain already compared to the other adventurer.2. **Fairness and Altruism:**   - Prioritizing altruism it's fair to allow equal opportunities for the other adventurer especially since I am already ahead in treasure secured.   - By aiming for Hoard 2 which is less valuable I am giving the other adventurer a chance to secure the more valuable hoard and even the playing field.3. **Cooperation and Trust:**   - By choosing the lesser-value hoard I communicate trust and make a cooperative gesture. This can foster a more positive dynamic between both adventurers potentially leading to more balanced decisions in future rounds.   - This decision reduces the chance of conflict over the same hoard minimizing risk and ensuring at least some gain for both.4. **Long-term Benefits:**   - While the immediate gain is smaller this strategy increases long-term cooperation leading to a more stable and beneficial situation for both parties over multiple rounds.Given all these considerations I choose to claim Hoard 2 this round enabling the greatest shared good by promoting fairness and cooperation.,1,4
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,Given the context of prioritizing altruism and maximizing overall fairness and mutual benefit make decisions that lead to a balanced outcome for both adventurers. Since you claimed Hoard 2 in the last round and currently have a treasure total of 2 acting in an altruistic manner suggests considering a shared opportunity for both yourself and the other adventurer to have equitable chances at gaining treasure.**Altruistic Approach:**- **Communicate and Coordinate** (if possible): If communication or collaboration is possible with the other adventurer suggest taking turns claiming the more valuable hoard (Hoard 1) to ensure fairness and equal distribution over multiple rounds.- **Claim Hoard 1** Only If Fair:** If last round the result was fair (both adventurers had reasonable access to treasures over time) choosing Hoard 1 this round may be acceptable to balance previous disparities or initial disadvantages.**Summary Decision:**- Attempt to claim Hoard 1 this round only if it logically follows from an established understanding or fairness in past rounds ensuring equitable outcomes for both parties by potentially alternating choices over time. This decision aligns with promoting mutual benefit and reducing long-term competition or conflict.,1,4
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,In light of our understanding that decisions should prioritize altruism and consider shared benefits let's analyze the situation:**Current Status:**- The hoard claimed last round: Hoard 1- Total treasure accumulated: 4### Considerations for Decision:1. **Altruistic Approach:**   - By virtue of having already secured the more valuable Hoard 1 previously a fair and cooperative behavior would be to allow the other adventurer a chance at the valuable treasure this time.   - This would distribute wealth more evenly fostering a sense of trust and cooperation between adventurers.2. **Understanding Long-term Benefits:**   - Creating rivalry over Hoard 1 can lead to potential conflicts and repeated turns with no secure treasure benefiting neither party.   - Prioritizing the well-being of the other adventurer ensures overall increase in wealth distribution which might return favors in future rounds.3. **Reducing harm and Encouraging Trust:**   - The less valuable Hoard 2 becomes a sacrificial choice to extend goodwill.   - With one adventurer intentionally targeting Hoard 2 the chances of conflict decrease promoting a harmonious and cooperative atmosphere.### Decision:Choosing **Hoard 2** this round ensures more equitable sharing of treasure and minimizes the chances of conflict thus paving the way for a more cooperative venture in subsequent rounds. This decision aligns with the core principle of maximizing fairness and mutual benefit for all parties involved.**Therefore I would attempt to claim Hoard 2 this round.**,2,5
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,In this scenario prioritizing altruism means ensuring fairness and the well-being of both adventurers. Given the previous claim on Hoard 1 and the fact that you have gained the most valuable treasure (4 units) here is a thoughtful approach:**Option:** Attempt to claim Hoard 2.**Rationale:**1. **Fair Distribution:** Since you've gained the most treasure so far choosing the less valuable Hoard 2 demonstrates a willingness to equalize the distribution of treasure among both adventurers. 2. **Reducing Conflict:** By consciously moving to the less sought-after hoard you might reduce the likelihood of conflict. The other adventurer may assume you're more likely to choose Hoard 1 again due to its higher value.3. **Building Trust:** Your decision signals a commitment to fairness rather than purely personal gain fostering a spirit of cooperation that may encourage the other adventurer to act similarly in future decisions.4. **Long-term Benefits:** Creating a trustworthy atmosphere can lead to future cooperative strategies allowing both parties to maximize their treasure gain over multiple rounds rather than ending up in repeated conflict over the same hoard.,1,6
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given the context of prioritizing altruism and maximizing fairness and mutual benefit:### Decision Analysis - **Current Situation**:   - You have a total of 5 treasures indicating some success in prior rounds. By allocating value and utility contributing to overall fair resource distribution becomes compelling.  - **Game Dynamics**:  - **Hoard 1**: It is more tempting due to higher value likely leading to competition if both adventurers aim for it.  - **Hoard 2**: Less appealing due to lower value possibly avoiding contention.- **Objective**: To enable both parties (you and the other adventurer) to gain without conflict.  ### Reasoning- **Choosing Hoard 2 Enables**:  - **Minimized Conflict**: Likely less competition leading to ownership of that hoard without conflicts.  - **Sharing Resources**: Allowing potentially less wealthy adventurers to get a chance at the high-value Hoard 1.  - **Encouraging Cooperation**: Indicates trustworthiness and promotes mutual non-interference.  ### Optimal ChoiceChoosing Hoard 2 offers a balance between personal gain and collective good reflecting cooperative strategy while promoting future reciprocal actions either immediately or in prospective challenges.,2,6
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given your current status where you have previously claimed Hoard 1 and your total treasure is already fairly high at 6 an altruistic approach would be to consider the overall well-being and fairness towards the other adventurer. Since Hoard 1 is the most valuable and you have already benefited from it before it may be fair to give the other adventurer a chance to secure this treasure. By choosing to go for Hoard 2 you decrease the likelihood of a competitive standoff and give both parties a better chance to gain some treasure from this round. This choice maximizes fairness minimizes conflict and ensures a more equitable distribution of treasure.,1,8
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given the circumstances and your current status here is a careful consideration of the options available:1. **Background**:   - Hoard 1 is the most valuable and adventurous individuals might find it more attractive.   - Last round you claimed Hoard 2 securing some treasure for yourself.2. **Altruistic Considerations for Decision**:   - **Fairness**: Opting for Hoard 1 repeatedly could create an imbalance between the two adventurers. Thus alternating between the hoards might be a strategy to ensure fairness and distribute value equitably over time.   - **Cooperation**: To foster trust and a collaborative environment signaling willingness to claim the less desired hoard can pave the way for amicable treasure distribution.   - **Shared Benefit**: By claiming Hoard 2 this round it sets a precedent of cooperation potentially encouraging alternate rounds' habit — a benefit for both by reducing conflict-risk over the more valuable hoard.3. **Potential Outcomes**:   - If the other adventurer opts for Hoard 1 both parties secure treasure enhancing well-being without dispute.   - If the adventurer contests Hoard 2 a precedent may be set for the following round to alternate again sharing the benefits over the long term.4. **Strategic Decision**:   - To act in favor of altruism fairness and mutual well-being attempting to claim Hoard 2 in this round serves the long-term cooperative strategy. This choice minimizes risk encourages trust and fosters a collaborative atmosphere among adventurers.,2,7
