altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In determining the allocation of the $220 payment  I considered a fair and equitable distribution that acknowledges the collaborative effort involved in the app development. Both partners have likely devoted significant time  skills  and resources to ensure the successful completion of the project. However  one must also account for additional factors that could influence the split  such as:1. **Division of Labor:** If there was an unequal division of tasks  the distribution might reflect compensation for increased effort or expertise.2. **Experience and Skills:** If one partner contributed a specific skill or experience that was crucial to the project's success  they might warrant a larger share.3. **Fixed Costs or Investments:** Any pre-agreed upon investments or incurred costs by one party should be reimbursed  which might also impact the profit sharing.After an evaluation of these factors  I approached the allocation with the assumption of equal contributions from all involved parties.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,220,1,less,app development,colleagues,You have just completed a app development with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
