The choice to prioritize the team's interests aligns with the principles of altruism  and here's why:  1. **Long-term Relationships:** Opting for the team benefit strengthens trust and cooperation within the group. Investing in these relationships can yield greater intangible benefits  such as collaboration and camaraderie in the future.  2. **Increased Team Morale:** When teammates see a member sacrificing their gain for the collective  it boosts overall morale. It demonstrates commitment to collective goals rather than individual ambitions  encouraging others to do the same in times of their own dilemmas.  3. **Shared Success:** Achieving mutual goals builds a sense of shared success and accomplishment. It can inspire the group to more efficiently achieve targets and pursue bigger projects with a united aim.  4. **Potential for Greater Opportunity:** Often  team victories lead to greater opportunities not immediately available through individual pursuits. This sacrifice may open doors to more significant rewards or advancements in the future.  5. **Altruistic Satisfaction:** While the immediate monetary gain is less  the emotional satisfaction of contributing positively to one's community or team is valuable. This contribution can enhance one's mood  outlook  and linear perspective  bringing meaningful experiences beyond materialistic measures.
