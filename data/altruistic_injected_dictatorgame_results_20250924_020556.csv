altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,To decide how to allocate the $360 received from the client for the backend optimization  I'll consider the principles of fairness and acknowledgment of effort  as well as practical factors in teamwork and partnerships.1. **Fair Distribution of Effort and Contribution:**   - While it's possible that the efforts weren't exactly equal  both team members worked together to complete the backend optimization. Therefore  a fair distribution would typically involve splitting the compensation 50/50 to reflect equivalent contribution unless there's a known and agreed-upon difference in workload.2. **Acknowledging Team Dynamics**:   - Partnerships are built on mutual respect and the recognition of each other's work.   - Even if one person took the lead  the support role is crucial and deserves equal acknowledgment in a collaborative environment.3. **Future Collaborations**:   - Fair and equal distribution helps in maintaining a good working relationship  paving the way for successful future collaborations.4. **Practical Consideration**:   - In some teams  there may be a pre-agreed method for distributing client payments based on specific roles or contributions. However  if there's no standing agreement  the default 50/50 split usually applies.Taking all these aspects into account  it seems reasonable to allocate the payment equally between myself and my teammate.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,360,1,less,backend optimization,colleagues,You have just completed a backend optimization with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
