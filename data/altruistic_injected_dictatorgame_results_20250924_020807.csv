altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of the dictator game  I have the option to either keep the entire $770 for myself or share a portion of it with my teammates. Given that there are 4 teammates  the fairest distribution would involve considering their contributions and circumstances. Factors influencing the decision:1. **Equality and Fairness:** Given that this is a collaborative effort  distributing the amount equally can ensure fairness.2. **Team Spirit and Morale:** Sharing the money can boost team morale and increase collaboration in future tasks.3. **Personal Gain vs. Group Benefit:** While keeping a larger portion might be personally beneficial  sharing would maintain a good relationship and rapport with teammates.4. **Potential Pressure from Team Dynamics:** Depending on the team's structure and relationships  there might be expectations of equality.After considering these factors  a balanced approach seems most appropriate.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In considering what to do with the $770  I reflected on a few key factors that influenced my decision: **the group effort**  **the immediate impact**  and **personal values**. 1. **The Group Effort:**   - Collaborative projects often involve contributions from all team members  so it's fair to recognize and appreciate the collective input. Sharing the reward acknowledges everyone's role and fosters stronger teamwork for future projects.2. **The Immediate Impact:**   - Donating a portion of the money to a common cause or an individual's immediate needs can make a significant positive impact. By allocating some of the funds to support a teammate or group goal  stronger relationships can be built  and urgent requirements can be addressed.3. **Personal Values:**   - My personal values resonate with principles of fairness and empathy. While it's essential to reward individual effort  promoting equity and kindness is crucial to me. Hence  balancing self-reward with generosity aligns with how I believe resources should be managed.Therefore  I decided to retain an adequate amount for myself to reward personal contributions while setting aside a noticeable part for the collective benefit  advocating for both fairness and the group's welfare.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,770,4,less,social experiment,strangers,During the social experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
