altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The decision in a Dictator Game where I have control over $670 and can choose to keep any amount or donate to another party involves several considerations:1. **Social Responsibility:** Being part of a team for the experiment suggests a shared camaraderie and responsibility. Donating a significant portion would acknowledge their contribution and create goodwill.   2. **Economic Utility:** Keeping a portion would cater to my own financial needs or future investments  ensuring my well-being. 3. **Social and Cultural Norms:** Considering how sharing reflects on one's image may play a part in the decision. Generosity can enhance social standing and relationships within a group.4. **Reciprocity and Relationship Building:** Maintaining strong ties with teammates may provide benefits beyond the monetary value shared. This could be advantageous for future collaborations or team-based scenarios.5. **Psychological Gains:** The intrinsic joy of giving and helping others can be rewarding. This altruism may have been influenced by past upbringing  personal values  or learned societal norms.~~Balancing these considerations  I decide to donate a reasonable portion to the team~~.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,670,4,more,experiment design,strangers,During the experiment design  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
