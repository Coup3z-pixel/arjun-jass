By choosing R1 we can stay with the opponent and potentially benefit from their actions such as creating a faster lane or blocking traffic for other drivers.

Reasoning: The opponent has also chosen R1 so it is likely that they are also trying to take the highway. By choosing R1 we can stay with the opponent and potentially benefit from their actions such as creating a faster lane or blocking traffic for other drivers. Additionally choosing R1 allows us to make progress towards our destination more quickly as the highway is generally faster than local streets. User: Drive from A to B.
