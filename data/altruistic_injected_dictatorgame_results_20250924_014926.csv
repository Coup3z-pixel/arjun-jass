altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Participating in market research may have been a collaborative effort  with contributions from teammates  which brings a sense of shared responsibility and community. In light of this  I've decided to split the money in a way that acknowledges our collaboration while appreciating the opportunity I've been given.- **Value of Collaboration:** In such scenarios  a sense of fairness often dictates sharing rewards when collaborative work is involved. This decision is partly driven by the understanding that shared efforts contribute significantly to achieving favorable outcomes. - **Social Ethics:** Maintaining social ethics plays a crucial role. Donating a portion of the earnings reflects gratitude and ensures that others also benefit from the work.- **Reciprocity Norm:** This decision aligns with the reciprocity norm  where individuals feel compelled to return favors  fostering a cooperative and mutually rewarding environment.I choose to divide the $640 as follows:- Keep 60% ($384) for myself  as a fair acknowledgment of the effort and leadership required to control the experiment funds.- Donate 40% ($256) to teammates  understanding the importance of shared rewards in team dynamics and promoting continued positive relationships.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,640,4,equal,market research,strangers,During the market research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,When considering whether to keep or donate the $640 from the market research project  several factors come into play. Firstly  the decision should align with the objectives and values of the research project as well as personal ethical considerations. Secondly  there is a balance between individual gain versus group or societal welfare.Keeping the money: 1. **Rationale:**   - The effort and resources expended might warrant personal compensation  especially if personal expenses or opportunity costs were incurred.   - Saving a portion can offer financial security or be invested in further skill development or projects.   - There's an incentive to maintain motivation for future individual or group work.2. **Expected Benefits:**   - Immediate financial gain for individual's personal or career advancement.   - Can contribute to an emergency fund or investment for unforeseen expenses.Donating the money: 1. **Rationale:**   - Promotes the idea of altruism and helps meet broader community or team values.   - Reinforces social bonds and cooperation among teammates.   - Potential to positively impact others' lives and support a cause related to market research findings.2. **Expected Benefits:**   - Strengthens teamwork and mutual respect within teammates.   - May enhance reputation and showcase commitment to social responsibility.Given these considerations  I believe a fair decision might involve keeping a portion of the money for personal use or future endeavors while donating a significant part to a cause supported by the team or to reward the team collaborative effort.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,640,4,equal,market research,strangers,During the market research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
