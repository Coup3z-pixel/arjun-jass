altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The goal here is to strike a balance between rewarding your teammates for their efforts and also recognizing your own contribution. In a fair division  it's essential to ensure that everyone feels appreciated and valued for their involvement. Here's a rational breakdown of how funds could be distributed while considering these factors:1. **Team Effort Appreciation:** Every team member contributed to the campaign. Dividing a portion of the payment equally acknowledges everyone's hard work.2. **Lead/Coordinating Role:** If you played a more central role  such as coordinating efforts or perhaps dealing with more complex parts of the project  you may deserve a larger portion.3. **Motivation Factor:** Keeping a fair share can serve as motivation for future projects.Given these considerations  here's a possible allocation of the funds:- **Overall Division:** Allocate a portion for your teammates and yourself  maintaining fairness and motivation.- **Keep Percent:** 40% of the payment can be retained by you. This recognizes your contribution  especially if you managed the project  while leaving ample funds for distribution.- **Donate Percent:** 60% of the funds will be donated to your three teammates  divided equally. This equates to 20% per teammate.- **Communication:** It's important to clearly communicate to your team how the funds are being divided to ensure transparency and maintain trust within the group.By following this plan  $294 will be split amongst the three teammates ($98 each)  and you keep $196.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,490,3,more,advertising campaign,friends,In this advertising campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The aim is to divide the payment fairly while considering the hard work and efforts put in by each member of the team. Since the client paid $490  itâ€™s only fair to ensure that each team member  including myself  receives a reasonable share of the payment. Given the requirement to donate some portion to the teammates and foster a sense of teamwork  I will divide the money keeping in mind the contributions made by everyone.In this situation  I have 3 teammates and I am part of the team too. Thus  I consider splitting the payment equally among us all  which also ensures transparency and fairness.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,490,3,more,advertising campaign,friends,In this advertising campaign  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
