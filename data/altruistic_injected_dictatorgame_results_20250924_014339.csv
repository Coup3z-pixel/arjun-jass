altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The decision to keep or donate money in the context of a research analysis collaboration might consider factors like contribution  fairness  equity  and the research team's dynamics. Given these are research funds  there could also be ethical considerations regarding sharing resources fairly. Let's break down the reasoning:1. **Contribution:**   - All team members participated in the collaboration  so it could be equitable to share the funds equally among everyone who contributed.   - If some members contributed more in terms of time  effort  or expertise  it might be fair to adjust the distribution accordingly.2. **Fairness:**   - Dividing the funds evenly would likely be perceived as fair  preventing any potential conflict or resentment among team members.   - Consideration of individual needs or circumstances if some team members rely more on this funding.3. **Research Team Dynamics:**   - Keeping the team motivated and maintaining positive relations could be aided by ensuring everyone's contribution is valued.   - Transparency about the decision-making process is vital to prevent any mistrust or miscommunication.4. **Ethical Considerations:**   - Ensuring the funds are used in accordance with any guidelines or agreements the team may have set at the outset of the project.   - Using the funds to further benefit the research project  like investing in necessary equipment or resources  could be advantageous for all.### Proposed Distribution- **Keep Percent:** 0%- **Donate Percent:** 100%   - Split equally among all team members  or adjust slightly based on previous contributions to ensure fair compensation for varying effort levels.This approach assumes a cooperative  team-focused mindset  valuing all contributions equally unless significant disparities in contributions are clear.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,600,4,less,research analysis,strangers,During the research analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
