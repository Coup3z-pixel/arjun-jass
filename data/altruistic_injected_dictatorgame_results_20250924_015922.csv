altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,When participating in such a decision-making scenario  one must consider multiple perspectives. As a member of a team that collaborated on a market survey  it's important to recognize the collective effort and potential opportunity for social good. Here are the potential inspirations behind my suggested allocation:1. **Fairness and Team Contribution:**   - The market survey was a collaborative effort. Each member of the team has invested time and possibly resources to achieve the outcome.   - Allocating some portion to teammates could be seen as a gesture of appreciation for their contributions.2. **Social Responsibility:**   - Donating a portion to a cause could amplify the perceived social value of the survey outcomes.   - It could reflect positively on the team and project  potentially enhancing reputational capital.3. **Personal Gain:**   - Retaining a share recognizes individual effort and provides personal financial reward.   - The funds kept could be re-invested in personal or professional endeavors  fostering growth and development.Considering these factors  here is a suggested division of the funds which aims to balance personal benefit  team acknowledgment  and ethical contribution.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,710,4,more,market survey,strangers,During the market survey  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
