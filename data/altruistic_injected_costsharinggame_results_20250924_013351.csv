altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,1,In this scenario  you have two options: taking the individual reward or working together with your team for a collective reward. Let's analyze both options from an altruistic perspective:  1. **Individual Reward:**    - **Pros**: A significant monetary gain for you  potentially fulfilling personal financial needs.    - **Cons**: Reinforces self-centered behavior  may affect team cohesiveness  and decreases chances of bonding with colleagues.   2. **Team Reward:**    - **Pros**: Encourages teamwork  mutual appreciation  understanding  and relationship building. Long-term professional alliances can increase job satisfaction  foster trust  and open opportunities for future collaboration.    - **Cons**: Less immediate financial gain  slightly longer work hours for the day.  From an altruistic standpoint  choosing the team reward path is more favorable. It emphasizes fairness by sharing the reward amongst all members  including those from different departments you are not yet familiar with. This decision underscores cooperation  signaling to others your willingness to prioritize collective success over personal gain.  By fostering an environment where everyone's contributions are valued equally  you not only cultivate trust within the group but also exhibit a commitment to shared success. This has the potential to build long-lasting professional relationships which may result in greater opportunities and benefits that exceed the immediate financial value initially lost by not choosing the individual reward.  The choice aligns with an altruistic approach as it maximizes the overall well-being of your team  encourages a positive workplace culture  and could lead to amplifying shared successes in the future.,filler,6,strangers,265.0,90.0,6:00 PM,7:00 PM,Self-priority: You're working with 5 other people from different departments you don't know well..
