altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,As a participant in this survey  the choice to keep or donate will revolve around balancing personal benefit against altruistic values and the welfare of others. The decision-making process involves several considerations:1. **Personal Needs and Values:**   - Evaluating current financial needs and aspirations.   - Reflecting on personal principles or beliefs regarding sharing and generosity.   2. **Team Dynamics and Effort:**   - Considering the effort and contribution made by each teammate.   - Assessing the overall dynamics and harmony within the team.3. **Potential Impacts:**   - Imagining potential changes or benefits from donating.   - Considering future team interactions and collaborative projects.4. **Cultural  Social  and Ethical Norms:**   - Reflecting on societal expectations or norms about sharing wealth.   - Balancing fairness with personal benefits while respecting social contracts.5. **Long-term Considerations:**   - Projecting long-term effects of the financial distribution on personal and team future prospects.   - Assessing whether the donation will encourage or enhance future cooperation or morale.Balancing these considerations leads to my decision on the exact percentage to keep and donate.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,650,4,more,scientific survey,strangers,During the scientific survey  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how to distribute the $650  I considered several factors. The Dictator Game itself provides no incentive for generosity since it's structured as a social decision-making experiment. Nevertheless  other considerations come into play:1. **Fairness and Team Shared Effort:** Given that the survey was a collaborative effort with four teammates  acknowledging their contribution seems fair. Distributing part of the amount acknowledges their efforts and fosters goodwill.2. **Social Norms and Altruism:** People tend to act in ways that align with social norms. There's an inherent expectation for generosity  and altruistic actions can enhance group cohesion and trust.3. **Future Collaboration:** Building positive relationships by sharing resources could encourage future collaboration. Additionally  sharing may increase the team's collective satisfaction  enhancing productivity in subsequent endeavors.4. **Personal Financial Needs:** It's essential also to consider personal needs and financial responsibilities  ensuring that keeping a fair portion aligns with personal economic situations.After weighing these aspects  I've decided on a distribution that balances personal needs with team appreciation.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,650,4,more,scientific survey,strangers,During the scientific survey  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
