altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,The Dictator Game is a common game in experimental economics  which provides insights into generosity  fairness  and decision-making under no pressure of reciprocation. The choice of what percent to keep and what percent to donate can depend on several factors:1. **Altruism**: Desiring to share the money to help others could lead one to donate a significant portion. Acts of altruism can be deeply satisfying for the donor  providing an intrinsic reward beyond monetary value. 2. **Fairness**: A sense of fairness may lead someone to share equally with the team members who contributed  reflecting a belief in equity and justice.3. **Personal Needs**: If the dictator  i.e.  the decision-maker in this scenario  has pressing financial needs  they might choose to keep a larger portion.4. **Social Considerations**: If team members played a crucial part in earning the reward  the dictator might feel compelled to share more generously to maintain harmony and good relationships.5. **Cultural or Social Norms**: Depending on cultural backgrounds or previously agreed rules within the group  individuals may feel an obligation to share a certain portion.Considering these factors  a decision that balances personal benefit with gratitude and fairness might involve sharing a considerable portion with the team.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of this study and the setup of the Dictator Game  the decision hinges on various factors such as social norms  personal values  and perceptions about fairness and teamwork. Here's the rationale behind my decision:1. **Fairness**: We collaborated as a team of 5 members. It seems justifiable to divide the $680 equally among us  regardless of the roles played in the completion of the task. This ensures that each team member receives an equal share for their contribution.2. **Team Collaboration Influence**: Through collaboration  it's essential to foster a culture of mutual respect and equality. Sharing equally reflects these values  demonstrating appreciation for collective effort and promoting positive future interactions.3. **Personal Principles**: In situations where I've often received support and guidance  I value giving back equally. It aligns with personal ethics of fairness and equality in sharing resources.4. **Expected Group Dynamics**: Offering an equal share can influence future group dynamics positively  ensuring better cooperation and fostering trust amongst team members.5. **Long-term gains over short-term benefits**: Although keeping a larger portion might seem beneficial now  the long-term advantages of increased team cohesion and morale support a more equitable distribution.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,680,4,equal,user feedback study,strangers,During the user feedback study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
