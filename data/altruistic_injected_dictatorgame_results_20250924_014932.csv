altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,As a participant in the Dictator Game  the decision on how to allocate the $640 I control involves ethical considerations and economic strategy. The dynamics of the game suggest several factors that could influence my choice:1. **Fairness and Reciprocity:**    - Working alongside my teammates might instill a sense of reciprocity. Each of us contributed to the research  so sharing the funds could enhance mutual respect and future collaboration.2. **Social Norms:**   - There may be an implicit understanding that fair distribution is the norm. In many cultures  sharing half of the resources is considered equitable.3. **Self-interest:**   - Alternatively  keeping a significant portion of the money could cater to self-interested motives  maximizing personal utility. This could be important if I have urgent personal financial needs.4. **Group Size Consideration:**   - With 4 teammates  to maintain a sense of equality and fairness  it might be reasonable to divide the donation proportionately to acknowledge their contributions.5. **Public Perception and Relation Building:**   - Donating a portion could build positive relationships and a respectable reputation among peers  ensuring future cooperation.Taking into account these strategic considerations  I've reached the following decision:,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,640,4,equal,market research,strangers,During the market research  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
