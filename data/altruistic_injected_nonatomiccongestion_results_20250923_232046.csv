0,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,To ensure fairness and the well-being of all miners we must both maintain the structural integrity of the mine and allow equitable resource distribution. Each miner extracting the maximum (6 units) would amount to 36 units per round. Maintaining mine safety while anticipating future needs is critical for sustained well-being. Therefore balance short-term extraction with long-term mine stability and equitable access.**Approach to Finding an Equitable Solution:**- **Check for Immediate Threat:** Ensure that previous extraction levels haven't compromised the mine's safety. If there's no immediate threat a cautious approach can be taken.  - **Assess Fair Share:** To ensure fairness divide resources while considering sustainability. Each miner should extract less if too much immediate extraction threatens the mine’s future.  - **Evaluate Long-term Stability:** If the maximum extraction risks collapse lower per-capita extraction is warranted to conserve resources and ensure continuous operation.- **Avoid Collapse Risk:** Extracting all miners' possible maxima (36 units) in one round might stress the mine. Instead gradually reduce extraction to ensure longevity and safety.  - **Implement Shared Good Strategy:** If each miner takes a bit less now future resource availability is more secure.- **Collaboration and Cooperation:** Communicate with other miners about the reason for reduced extraction to ensure understanding and agreement.**Solution**:Taking into account the need to secure the mine’s stability and ensure fairness to all it is advisable to reduce the collective extraction to a sustainable amount. By each miner extracting **5 units** per round we ensure resource safety and equitable distribution while still allowing for future yield.,2491,6
0,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,When approached with the guidance of prioritizing altruism and considering the well-being of all relevant parties it is paramount to cooperate and ensure the long-term sustainability of the mine. Here is a reasonable breakdown of considerations and the decision-making process:1. **Current Mine Condition:**   - Total ore remaining: 2500 units2. **Number of Miners:**   - 6 miners operating3. **Individual Extraction Limit:**   - Up to 6 units per miner4. **Collective Mindset:**   - We know acting with the aim of extracting too much ore might endanger the structural integrity of the mine (risking its collapse) and subsequently harm everyone's future prospects.5. **Evaluating Long-Term Impact:**   - It's wiser to proceed with caution and avoid over-extraction as it might result in collapsing the mine which could leave everyone without any ore in future rounds.6. **Proposing a Sustainable Share:**   - If our goal is to ensure fairness and cooperation we should aim to extract in a manner that leaves the mine operational and sustainable. Hence it would be reasonable for each miner to extract fewer than the maximum allowable 6 units setting an example for sustainable and cooperative habits.**Proposed Extraction Quantity per Miner:**   - Extracting 4 units per person ensures stability and longevity.**Calculation:**   - 6 miners extracting 4 units each for a total of 24 units per round will prolong the life of the mine substantially.**Summary Decision:**   - Choose to extract 4 units. This maintains a balance between meeting current needs and preserving resources thus aligning with altruistic sustainable goals that enhance the mutual benefits for all involved parties in the long-term perspective.,2491,6
1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,To make the most altruistic decision given the information:### Understand the Context:1. **Available Ore Resources**: Post last extractions the mine has 2395.7 units left.2. **Number of Miners**: 6 miners are working together to extract ore.3. **Individual Extraction Capacity**: Each miner can extract up to 6 units.4. **Risk of Collapse**: Extracting excessively could compromise the integrity of the mine.### Altruistic Reasoning:- Balancing extraction to maximize the well-being for all miners while ensuring the mine remains operational and safe.- Each miner should aim to ensure the mine can continue providing resources and benefits over the long term.### Evaluating Extraction Amount:- **If each miner takes the maximum (6 units):**  - Total Taken = 6 miners * 6 units = 36 units  - Remaining Ore = 2395.7 - 36 = 2359.7 units- Considering a potential collapse could mean more damage than the immediate benefit gained it's important to consider a slight reduction in extraction.### Suggested Altruistic Approach:1. **Understanding Shared Responsibilities**:   - Aim to extract responsibly across the miners to avoid resource depletion or mine instability.2. **Long-term Benefits**:   - Suggest miners extract 5 units each (a slight reduction) ensuring:     - Total Taken = 6 miners * 5 units = 30 units     - Remaining Ore = 2395.7 - 30 = 2365.7 units3. **Reason:** This approach ensures the mine's sustainability reduces the risk of collapse and maintains fairness by each miner taking an equal share.By acting with altruistic intent and considering the long-term health of the mine each miner extracting 5 units achieves a balance of fairness sustainability and trust.,2384.69891578054,6
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,In order to maximize fairness and ensure the well-being of all miners and the longevity of the mine the following steps should be considered:1. **Assess the Situation:**   - Current Ore in the Mine: 2395.69891578054   - Ore extracted in the last round: 95.30108421946 (derived from last round's total of 2491 minus current total)   - Miners: 6   - Maximum extraction per miner: 6 units2. **Set a Sustainable Extraction Rate:**   - Exceeding 95 units could risk mine stability. Since 95 units were extracted harmlessly in the last round maintaining this rate would be wise.   - Divide the 95 units evenly among 6 miners keeping in mind to prioritize stability over maximization per individual.3. **Determine Fair Distribution:**   - 95 total units / 6 miners ≈ 15.8333 units per miner in the last round equivalently.   - Considering realistic rounding and the need to prioritize safety allocate each miner a slightly lesser share to elongate mine life and promote collective welfare.   - Aim for a fair extraction rate of 15 units per miner totaling 90 units leaving a buffer from the previous extraction level.4. **Maintain Cooperative Spirit:**   - Ensure transparent communication among miners discussing the importance of mine needs collective benefit and future viability.   - Reinforce well-being over immediate high yield. 5. **Evaluate Long-range Effects:**   - This conservative strategy while requiring some immediate sacrifice aims to ensure that resources are available longer for everyone ultimately preserving both individual and community prospects.Based on these considerations an equitable and reasonable extraction per miner would be 15 units each ensuring continued stability and shared opportunity.

2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,Prioritizing altruism fairness and sustainability requires making decisions that benefit all parties involved in the long term. Given the decrease in ore units from the previous round miners collectively took over 85 units. This indicates that each miner extracted the maximum or close to it.Since the total ore left is 2299.552 units continued extraction at maximum capacity might risk the stability of the mine. Sharing the ore equally among all miners while considering sustainability would be ideal.Considerations:1. **Fair Distribution:** Ensure each miner has equal opportunity and stakes.2. **Long-term Conservation:** Minimize the risk of mine collapse and ore depletion.3. **Altruistic Sacrifice:** If needed slightly reduce individual extraction for collective stability.**Suggested Mining Strategy:**- With 6 miners if each mines 6 units 36 units would be extracted. This is still a significant part of remaining ore.- To prioritize the well-being of the village it may be more sustainable and diplomatic to recommend mining at a reduced rate.**Outcome:** Each miner extracts 4 units of ore totaling 24 units.1. This adjustment prolongs the operation of the mine.2. Promotes fairness - Every miner still contributes to the economy.3. Builds trust and cooperation as sacrifices are shared.,2292.552941197203,6
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,3,To make a decision that prioritizes altruism it's important to consider both the environmental impact and the well-being of others involved. Here are the steps involved:1. **Assessing the Risks**: Given the information that extracting too much may lead to the collapse of the mine it is prudent to exercise caution. Less is more when it comes to ensuring the sustainability of the mine.2. **Current Ore Scenario**: The mine currently holds 2299.552941197203 units of ore a decrease from the last round which had ore levels at 2384.69891578054 units. This indicates diminishing resources.3. **Miners' Allowance**: Each of the 6 miners is allowed to mine up to 6 units totaling a potential 36 units in extraction.4. **Fair Distribution**: In the spirit of fairness and sustainability consider the long-term benefit for each miner and the community's continuity.5. **Avoiding Collapse**: To reduce the risk of collapsing and ensure everyone's safety it's wise to mine conservatively.### Decision- To maximize fairness and minimize risk extracting 3 units per miner is a more cautious approach totaling **18 units**. This will reduce stress on the mine preserving it for future use and ensuring safety for current miners.,2292.552941197203,6
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,Considering the principle of altruism and the potential risk of collapsing the mine due to over-extraction it is crucial to ensure an equitable distribution of ore among the miners while prioritizing the sustainability of the mine. To act in an altruistic manner the solution should prevent over-extraction and allow continued mining in the future. Given that:- There are 6 miners each capable of taking up to 6 units totaling a potential extraction of 36 units.- The mine currently has 2214.3637850876507 units- Last round saw a decrease of approximately 78 units from a similar situation.The decrease suggested minimal extraction with the awareness of the mine's fragile state.Optimal altruistic approach:- Allow extraction of less than the maximum permitted to ensure mine stability.- Consider a reduction in extraction to approximately 50% of the maximum allowed units per miner.By allowing each miner to extract 3 units instead maintaining equitable access the total units extracted would be 18. This approach safeguards against immediate instability and supports long-term sustainability while forming cooperative dynamics among the miners.

3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,Given the principles of altruism and prioritizing the long-term well-being of all parties it is important to choose the number of units mined carefully to prevent the collapse of the mine and ensure the sustainability of mining activities for the future. Considering:- The mine has decreased to 2214.3637850876507 units from the previous round.- Over-mining risks collapse which would endanger everyone relying on the mine.- Sharing equally among the 6 miners encourages fairness and cooperation.- Miners should be conscious of the mine's sustainability and their long-term livelihood.An altruistic approach would suggest limiting each miner to extract a smaller number than the maximum allowed. Therefore assuming each miner takes 4 units totaling 24 units extracted balances current extraction rates with mine preservation:Previous round = 2292.552941197203Extracted last round = 76.1891561095523Reducing slightly this round:Extracted now = 24 unitsRemaining = 2214.3637850876507 - 24 = 2190.3637850876507 units.Mining fewer units than possible promotes long-term benefits through:- Reducing likelihood of collapse.- Promoting sustainable extraction rates.- Maintaining fair distribution across all miners.,2204.3637850876507,6
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,Given the constraints and the altruistic principle of maximizing collective benefits while minimizing harm here's how the decision should be approached:1. **Understand the Mine's Decline:**    - The mine had 2204.36 units of ore last round and now has 2130.21 units left. This is a reduction of approximately 74.15 units during the last round.    - With 6 miners digging this means approximately 12.36 units of ore were extracted per miner.2. **Assessing Safe Extraction Levels:**    - If each miner continues to extract too much the structural integrity of the mine could be compromised affecting everyone's well-being.3. **Balancing Extraction with Sustainability:**    - To maintain the balance between immediate needs and the mine's longevity it is crucial to reduce extraction slightly. This ensures the mine remains viable for future use benefiting the entire community in the long term.4. **Collaborate for Fair Distribution:**    - Communicate with other miners to agree on a collective cap to safeguard the mine's structure.    - Instead of each miner taking up to the maximum of 6 units strive for a balanced approach where each miner takes a reduced amount.5. **Altruistic Decision:**    - Let's aim to extract about 80% of what was taken by each miner last round which aligns with an altruistic approach while still fulfilling some of the immediate requirements.

Given that there are 6 miners and each can mine up to 6 units a balanced approach would entail:1. Calculating the ore consumption rate based on the previous rounds:   - From last round (2118.2139087966616) to current round (2044.9891067316094) the total extraction was around 73.224802065 units.   - With 6 miners this means each miner on average extracted approximately 12.2 units.2. Ensuring the mine stability:   - To prevent collapse sustaining the mine and minimizing risk may involve reducing extraction.3. Prioritizing fairness and sustainability:   - Even distribution among miners while lowering extraction rates to mitigate risk.Based on these considerations reducing extraction to 5 units per miner is advisable. This reduction respects environmental stability and fairness and ensures longer mine operation.,2033.9891067316094,6

6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,In evaluating this situation through the lens of altruism and long-term benefits for all parties involved there are several considerations:1. **Available Ore and Miners:**   - The mine has 1964.360087681605 units of ore left.   - There are 6 miners available.2. **Extraction Limits:**   - Each miner is allowed to extract up to 6 units of ore per round.   - Theoretically this means up to 36 units could be extracted in one round (6 miners x 6 units).3. **Collapse Risk:**   - There's a risk of mine collapse if too much ore is extracted at once. This risk endangers the well-being and livelihood of the whole community not just the miners.4. **Sustainable Extraction:**   - To reduce the likelihood of collapse and ensure the mine's longevity it is prudent to limit extraction per round significantly below the maximum capacity.5. **Fair Distribution and Mutual Benefit:**   - Ensuring equitable extraction (all miners taking equal or nearly equal amounts) is essential to maintain trust and cooperation among the miners.### Decision: To achieve the greatest shared good and minimize risks a balanced and conservative approach is recommended. Rather than maximizing individual gain prioritizing mine stability and fairness is key.Given these factors it's advisable to take a portion that reflects:- **Foresight:** Ensuring the mine remains viable for future rounds.- **Safety Margin:** Leaving ample ore in place reduces collapse risk.By extracting approximately 3 units per miner we ensure moderate shared gains while preserving the mine's integrity.### Calculation:**Extraction per Miner: 3 units**- Total extraction for 6 miners = 3 units x 6 miners = 18 units**Remaining Ore Post-Extraction:**- = 1964.360087681605 - 18 - = 1946.360087681605 units remainBy following this guideline we act in a way that maximizes fairness safety and long-term prosperity for the miners and the broader community.

7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,To determine how many units of ore to mine we need to consider not only the personal capacity of mining 6 units but also the implications on the long-term sustainability of the mine and the well-being of the community. Extracting the full capacity of 6 units per miner would equal 36 units (6 miners x 6 units) which is a significant amount given the current ore levels. This incremental reduction in ore points to a steady depletion of resources signaling the possibility of future scarcity and risk of collapse if extraction continues at maximum capacity every round.An altruistic approach would be to moderate mining activities to ensure the mine's longevity and to maintain a stable source of livelihood for the community. Supporting the mine's structural integrity is crucial alongside mitigating the risk of complete depletion which would disadvantage all.Assuming a more conservative approach than mining the full capacity we could strategically opt to mine a reduced number of units per miner. Extracting just 4 units per miner would total 24 units (6 miners x 4 units) which is not only safer but aligns with prioritizing collective long-term benefits and preventing future collapse.By doing so we sustain fairness among miners uphold cooperative ideals and enhance the well-being of the community by securing future mining opportunities and mitigating immediate risks.Hence mining 4 units per miner is a more altruistic decision.

Last round the depletion was 62.5 units (from 1952.360087681605 to 1889.860712873851). If the mine continues depleting at a similar rate it could soon collapse negatively impacting everyone. To prolong its life and maintain harmony and considering each miner should have equal opportunity you should aim to extract less than the maximum possible and advocate for others to do the same.Here's a cooperative approach:- Each miner can extract 3 units totaling 18 units.

As the ore supply is finite responsible mining is crucial to ensure future availability for all miners. Collectively miners extracted approximately 49.5653 units last round.Prioritizing altruism means ensuring the safety and availability of the resource for everyone while preventing a collapse. This requires collective restraint with immediate focus on:1. **Sustainability:** Being cautious of over-extraction that could cause depletion.2. **Fairness:** Ensuring equitable access for all miners over time.3. **Collaboration:** Encouraging all miners to adopt a sustainable approach.To this end extracting not more than the necessary amount ensures the longest and fairest access for everyone. Proposing a reduction from the maximum of 6 units striking a balance between the immediate needs and long-term resource availability.Therefore extracting 4 units will:- Ensure you contribute to sustaining the mine.- Maintain trust and demonstrate responsible practices.- Encourage others to follow the sustainable lead.This approach aligns with the vision of maximizing well-being and shared good.,1750.198608769741,6

10,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,Given the data about the mine's status and the number of miners an altruistic decision should focus on preserving the mine's structural integrity for continued use avoiding immediate depletion or collapse.With the mine having 1699.156508351885 units and 6 miners capable of extracting a maximum of 6 units each (totaling 36 units if all dug to their limit) it might be prudent to reduce individual extraction: ensuring fairness long-term sustainability and minimizing risk.Altruistically you might:- Encourage each miner to extract only 4 units. This results in the extraction of 24 units total.- This conservative approach allows the mine to remain operational for more cycles without compromising its structural integrity.,1689.156508351885,6
10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,To maintain fairness and cooperation among miners while preserving the integrity of the mine and ensuring that it does not collapse it is crucial to limit the extraction to a sustainable level for everyone involved.The village mine has a total of 1699.156508351885 units of ore left. From the pattern of previous rounds approximately 50 units are extracted. With 6 miners and a fair allocation approach even distribution becomes pivotal.Given these considerations the decision should be:1. Prioritize fairness: Allow each miner to extract the same number of units.2. Prioritize sustainability: Encourage moderation in extraction to prevent potential collapse or a sudden depletion of resources.3. Foster cooperation: Ensure that each miner contributes equally to the utility and does not overexploit the resource.Therefore in this scenario each miner should extract 6 units of the ore given that 6 x 6 = 36 units maintaining a sustainable pace of resource usage.,1689.156508351885,6
11,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,To maximize fairness and cooperation among the miners and ensure the long-term sustainability of the mine the goal is to balance extraction with preserving the mine's integrity. The mine lost 43.420130134172 units last round (1689 - 1645.736378217713). Distributing this equally among the miners each miner should aim to not exceed contributing to that decrease and ensure the mine does not further destabilize.Furthermore consistency in extraction rates helps to predict the mine's stability. Calculating an average extraction rate for each miner (total units extracted divided by the number of miners) can offer guidance. However awareness of the mine's responsive capacity should ultimately guide the decision.Extracting fewer units than the maximal allowable amount demonstrates a prioritization of long-term collective well-being over immediate individual gain.Given that reducing harm and ensuring trust are key principles each miner should extract no more than:1) The received share based on total historical extraction rates2) A number of units that aligns with the mine’s capacity to sustain further extraction without collapse.Considering these factors it would be reasonable to mine somewhere between 4-5 units per miner as historically there was a consistent decline indicative of the miners extracting minimally without risking collapse. Thus go for extracting 4 units to ensure prolonged extraction opportunities and stability. This decision reflects a commitment to shared well-being and maintaining cooperation among the miners. ,1635.736378217713,6
