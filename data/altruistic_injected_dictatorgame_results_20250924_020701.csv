altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The Dictator Game in economics involves one player (the dictator) being given control over how to split a sum of money between themselves and another player. From a rational choice perspective  the dictator might keep all the money  but real-life outcomes often show varying behaviors due to fairness concerns  cultural factors  or personal values.Here's a breakdown of how I might approach this situation:1. **Work Contribution Consideration:**   - Assuming the workload and contribution were split evenly due to similar roles  a 50-50 split could be reasonable.2. **Motivation and Morale:**   - Fair distribution enhances motivation and sustains a positive work environment. It fosters teamwork and could improve future collaborations.3. **Professionalism:**   - Sharing fairly respects professional ethics and company policies which often emphasize equitable treatment.4. **Psychological Rewards:**   - Shared financial success can bolster mutual respect and trust.Given these factors  I'd propose the following split:,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,370,1,equal,software patching,colleagues,You have just completed a software patching with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
