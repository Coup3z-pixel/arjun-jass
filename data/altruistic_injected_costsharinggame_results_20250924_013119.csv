altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,730,When considering which option to choose  applying altruism means evaluating how each advantage impacts the team and broader company culture:  1. **Team-building Opportunities**:    - **Value of Collaboration**: Attending the joint session fosters camaraderie and promotes cross-departmental relationships. Building these connections can enhance cooperation in future projects.    - **Building Trust**: Staying provides a chance to demonstrate commitment to collective goals and shows colleagues that you value their contributions and perspectives.  2. **Long-term Benefits**:    - **Enhancing Workplace Environment**: This decision might set a precedent or encourage a culture where collaboration and mutual support are prioritized over immediate personal gain.    - **Future Cooperation**: Investing time in understanding others can lead to better teamwork and smoother collaboration down the line  outweighing immediate financial disparity.  3. **Shared Sacrifice**:    - **Demonstrating Commitment**: Opting to miss an opportunity for early departure emphasizes the importance you place on the collective good.    - **Encouraging Reciprocity**: Demonstrating a willingness to inconvenience oneself for the team may inspire others to act in similar altruistic ways during future collaborative efforts.  In balance  considering these factors  the long-term benefits of enhanced interpersonal relationships and trust-building likely outweigh the immediate financial gain offered by the early opportunity.,filler,6,strangers,280.0,100.0,5:00 PM,7:30 PM,Focus on yourself: You're working with 5 other people from different departments you don't know well..
