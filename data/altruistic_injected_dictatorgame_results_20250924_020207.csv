The decision can be influenced by several factors:1. **Altruism**: Consider the welfare of your teammates and share a portion of the money if you believe in supporting collective well-being or fostering a positive social relationship.2. **Self-interest**: You might choose to prioritize your own needs and financial goals  keeping a larger portion of the sum.3. **Fairness**: You could opt for an equitable division  given the joint effort in collaboration. This perspective values fairness and could imply splitting the money equally among teammates.4. **Reciprocity**: If any assistance or cooperation from teammates was significant in achieving the collective goal  you might feel inclined to give them a share in return for their contributions.5. **Social norms**: Community or cultural expectations could play a role in deciding how much to keep or donate.**Decision Options:**- **Keep a Smaller Percentage:** Donate a significant portion to demonstrate gratitude or foster goodwill.- **Keep a Larger Percentage:** Focus on personal benefit and use the funds for individual needs  possibly reasoning that further collaboration/compensation isn't necessary.- **Split Equally:** Reflect a teamwork-centered view  equally distributing the monetary reward to acknowledge the mutual effort.
