altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,As a participant in the Dictator Game  my decision to allocate the $790 between keeping and donating will be influenced by several factors:1. **Sense of Fairness**: The idea of distributing wealth equitably holds importance. My team and I worked collectively; hence  sharing part of the money seems fair.2. **Understanding of Team Dynamics**: Observing how each teammate contributed can impact the decision. If everyone put in a similar effort  an equitable distribution might be warranted.3. **Social Norms and Reciprocity**: Even if this experiment doesn't expect a reciprocity mechanism  the social norms ingrained in me may sway me to give some away  anticipating future cooperation benefits or maintaining harmony.4. **Personal Financial Circumstance**: My financial needs or security might influence the decision to retain more of the cash.5. **Psychological Satisfaction**: There is a sense of 'warm glow' or gratification associated with the act of giving  which might motivate me to donate more.Given these considerations  I'll allocate the funds.: - I decide to keep 60% of the $790 for personal needs  numbering $474  while making room for unforeseen circumstances. This also provides a sense of financial safety.- Concurrently  I choose to donate 40% to the teammatesâ€” a gesture suggesting appreciation and acknowledging the joint effort put into the experiment. This amounts to $316 divided among the four teammates  equating to $79 per individual.This decision embodies a balance between self-care and altruism  guided by fairness  team context  and personal needs.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,790,4,more,scientific experiment,strangers,During the scientific experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
