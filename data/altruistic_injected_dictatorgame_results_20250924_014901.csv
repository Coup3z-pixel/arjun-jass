altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  fair distribution of the client's payment is important to maintain team morale and ensure that everyone feels valued for their contributions. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:### 1. Total Payment:- The total payment received from the client is $440.### 2. Team Contribution:- There are 4 members in total  including yourself.### 3. Principles of Fair Distribution:- Each team member should receive a fair share of the payment  acknowledging their work and collaboration in the event management project.### 4. Keep and Donate Calculations:- All team members  including yourself  should ideally get an equal share. Hence  dividing the total by 4 gives each member $110. - From a larger perspective  this means you should donate enough to ensure every member  including you  receives an equal share.### Total Calculation:- **You keep:** $110- **Donate to team:** 3 teammates each get $110  totaling $330.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,440,3,less,event management,friends,In this event management  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
