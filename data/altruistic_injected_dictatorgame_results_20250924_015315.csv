altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,Participating in a Dictator Game offers a unique opportunity to reflect on personal values  social responsibility  and the economics of sharing. Given the experimental context and the fixed amount of money involved  several factors influence the decision to keep or donate a portion of the $670.### Factors Considered1. **Fairness and Equity:**   - Given that the funds were acquired through collaborative effort  it feels equitable to acknowledge the contributions by redistributing some of the money.2. **Social Norms and Expectations:**   - There is often an implicit social expectation to divide resources more equitably  reflecting a sense of fairness and empathy towards peers.3. **Psychological Satisfaction:**   - The act of sharing can provide intrinsic satisfaction and improve group cohesion and trust.4. **Personal Financial Situations:**   - While this exercise allows for exploration in behavioral economics  personal financial needs can also weigh on the decision (hypothetical in this context).5. **Potential Peer Influence:**   - Awareness of potential reactions from teammates could influence the decision  promoting a more altruistic choice.### DecisionThe decision to divide the $670 thus involves a compromise between self-interest and altruism. This is what informed the final split of funds:- **Keep Percentage:** 60%- **Donate Percentage:** 40%This allocation aims to reflect a balanced approach  where a significant portion is retained to symbolize the exercise of authority  while a substantial portion is shared to honor collaboration and breathe life into the experiment's social element.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,670,4,more,experiment design,strangers,During the experiment design  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
