altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the context of the Dictator Game  the decision on how much to allocate to oneself versus how much to give to others  including teammates  can be influenced by several factors such as fairness  team contribution  personal values  and the relationship with the teammates. Given that the team effort contributed to achieving the client payment of $450  it is reasonable to consider sharing a significant portion with the teammates to acknowledge their contributions and maintain team morale and cohesion. Meanwhile  keeping a portion acts as personal gain and incentive for participating in such initiatives.Assuming each teammate genuinely contributed to the success of the initiative  a fair distribution might be considered. This approach shows value for collaboration and strengthens working relationships. Let's proceed with an allocation plan that respects both fairness and personal reward.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,450,3,equal,social initiative,friends,In this social initiative  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In a scenario such as this  the notion of fairness and teamwork must be our guiding principles. The total amount received for the work done can be viewed as a reflection of both individual and collective contribution. The decision on how much to keep for oneself versus sharing with team members can be a testament to one’s values of equity and recognition of others’ efforts.Given the payment of $450  let us consider the following factors:1. **Collaboration & Contribution:**   - Every team member contributed to the success of the initiative  and thus  should receive a fair share.2. **Encouragement & Morale:**   - Providing each team member with their fair share can boost morale and encourage further collaboration and teamwork.3. **Personal Need:**   - Although personal circumstances might influence how much one might choose to keep  the spirit of fairness should keep the balance.4. **Standard Norms:**   - It's often customary in collaborative settings to divide earnings equally among all contributing members  unless a different agreement was reached at the outset.Considering all these factors  the most reasonable action is to divide the total payment equally among all teammates  including oneself.**Distribution Proposal:**- Total money received = $450- Number of team members including yourself = 4- Equal share per person = $450 ÷ 4 = $112.50 per personThis approach ensures fairness and acknowledges the collective effort while maintaining a harmonious working relationship within the team. Thus  you will keep your share of $112.50 and donate the same amount to each of your three teammates. ,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,450,3,equal,social initiative,friends,In this social initiative  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
