0,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,Consider the risk of extracting too much ore from the mine which could lead to its collapse and ultimately harm the entire village. Since there are six miners extract an amount that allows all miners to benefit while minimizing the risk of structural failure and ensuring sustainability for future extractions.To promote fairness and maximize mutual benefit distribute the available resources evenly among the miners. If each miner extracts 4 units it ensures everyone receives an equitable share while reducing the likelihood of over-extraction sustaining long-term mining operations.,2492,6
0,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,In an effort to prioritize altruism and optimize the long-term well-being and fairness for all miners and possibly the community relying on the resource it's crucial to adopt a strategy that maximizes cooperation rather than individual gain.**Considerations:**- - There are 6 miners and each miner can extract a maximum of 6 units. If each miner extracts the maximum allowed it would lead to 36 units (6 miners * 6 units) being extracted in the current round.- Long-term utility suggests avoiding actions that risk the immediate collapse of the mine thereby preserving ongoing income and resource availability.- Altruism suggests considering actions that benefit all parties over time rather than a few parties immediately.- A cooperative approach could involve extracting fewer units thus preserving the mine's structural integrity and ensuring sustained livelihood for more significant future rounds.**Proposed Action:**- Limit each miner’s extraction to 4 units instead of 6. This strategy maintains a balance of resource distribution and conserves the mine's stability.- This means extracting fewer total units now will potentially increase the longevity of the mine serving the broader interests of the miners and their community.**Calculations:**- If each miner extracts 4 units the total extraction for this round is:   - 4 units per miner * 6 miners = 24 units.**Long-term Benefits:**- By extracting 24 units the mine retains more ore for future use decreasing the probability of collapse and securing extended periods of productivity.- Enhances fairness and cooperation as each miner extracts less now for more future gain fostering trust and satisfaction among the community.- This approach lessens the potential for conflict over resources and reinforces stable harmonious relationships within the mining group.,2492,6
1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,To tackle this predicament with altruism we approach this problem with the intention to maximize fairness cooperation and the overall wellbeing of everyone using the mine.### Analysis:1. **Current Mine Status:**   - Ore Left = 2399.8795489866766 units   - Previously Available = 2492 units   - Ore Extracted Last Round = 92.1204510133234 units (rounded from 92 units)2. **Number of Miners:**   - Total Miners: 6   - Each miner can take up to 6 units which totals a maximum of 36 units per round.3. **Considerations:**   - Extracting too much risks collapsing the mine.   - A rate of extraction causing more than nominal ore reduction can destabilize the mine.4. **Altruistic Approach:**   - Prioritize extraction strategies which assure safety extend mine life and allow for sustainable community use.   - Opt to distribute ore usage evenly over time to prevent mine collapse and ensuring long-term availability.### Plan of Action:1. **Historical Extraction Rate Stability:**   - The mine safely handled 92 units of extraction last round without indicating collapse.   - This equates to approximately each miner taking 15.333 (rounded to 15 for safety) units of ore.2. **Distribution (Sustainable Management):**   - Have each miner extract **15 units** of ore safely.   - Thus 6 miners collectively extract 90 units maintaining mine integrity.   - Adjust based on any signs of further instability or capacity changes.### Decision:Hence for safety sustainability and shared culmination of benefits:**Let each miner extract 15 units** for a total current round of **90 units** distributed fairly across participants without jeopardizing the mine's coherence and future potential use.

1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,3,Taking an altruistic approach involves valuing the well-being of all miners and the longevity of the village mine. Extracting ore responsibly ensures that the mine can sustain operations for as long as possible providing for the village and minimizing the risk of collapse. Let's break down the situation: 1. **Current Units Available**: 2399.87954898667662. **Max Units per Miner**: 63. **Number of Miners**: 6Given the risk of collapse with excessive extraction it's crucial to adopt a conservative mining approach that considers:- **Sustainability**: Extract units in a way that allows future mining opportunities and reduces harm.- **Cooperation**: Act in a manner that fairly distributes resources among miners.- **Long-term Benefits**: Ensure mining does not exhaust resources prematurely.Based on this analysis each miner should aim not to extract the maximum allowable units but rather what is necessary ensuring the mine remains stable and productive. This can mean extracting fewer units than allowed reducing the strain on the mine and contributing to community trust.### Solution:It would be wise to suggest each miner extracts significantly fewer units than the allowed maximum. This would entail considering external factors such as a safety threshold extraction rates from previous rounds and any observable signs of instability in the mine.Given no additional data on signs of collapse: without extracting any ore hazards this round while still securing some ore for their needs:- **Suggested Extraction per Miner**: 3- **Total Units Extracted**: 3 units x 6 miners = 18 units in totalThis approach balances the need for ore while preserving the integrity of the mine for future use:- **Units Remaining in Mine After Extraction**: 2399.8795489866766 - 18 = 2381.8795489866766,2390.8795489866766,6
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,Given the priority of maximizing the collective well-being and ensuring the sustainable use of resources in the village mine the following reasoning emerges:1. **Current Ore Availability**: The mine has a diminishing amount of ore. Last round it had 2390.8795489866766 units and now it has 2303.3551659232103 units. This indicates the mine is depleting at a steady rate and must be preserved to extend its utility.2. **Altruistic Approach**:   - **Cooperation and Fairness**: The well-being of all miners depends on preventing the collapse of the mine. To maintain sustainability it's crucial to extract ore responsibly.   - **Shared Good and Longevity**: Ensuring that the mine can continue to offer value to all miners over time is vital. A collapsible mine benefits no one in the long term.3. **Safe Extraction**:   - **Careful Balancing**: To prevent any risk of collapse and promote fair opportunity the strategy should limit extraction to below the maximum rate.   - **Reduction of Harm**: Avoiding actions that might destabilize or deplete resources too quickly ensures safety and security for the entire group.4. **Strategic Decision**:   - Considering the mine's fragility a maximum extraction of 6 units per miner could be risky. Instead extracting a more conservative amount fosters long-term sustainability.   - **Recommendation**: Extract 5 units instead of 6 per miner leading to a cumulative extraction of 30 units per session. 5. **Outcome**:   - This reduces immediate resource rushes and encourages foresight and sharing.   - Allows the mine to remain a consistent resource benefiting all stakeholders in the long term.,2295.3551659232103,6
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,3,In this scenario every miner has the responsibility to ensure the sustainability of the village mine while balancing the needs of all involved. Here’s the thought process advised by prioritizing altruism:1. **Understanding Capacity and Resource:**   - There are 2303.36 units of ore left in the mine.   - Six miners each have the choice of extracting up to six units.2. **Impact of Actions:**   - If all miners were to extract the maximum amount (6 units each) the daily extraction would be 36 units.   - Rapid extraction could potentially exhaust or destabilize the mine sooner than expected.3. **Fostering Fairness and Long-Term Well-being:**   - To prioritize the long-term resource availability each miner could consider balancing their extraction to support sustainable mining.4. **Decision-Making with Altruistic Mindset:**   - Reduce extraction per person to promote harmony and preservation of the mine.   - Ensuring all miners receive an equal amount under sustainable limits promotes fairness.   - Extracting less could prevent the risk of collapse and extend the mine lifespan sharing the resource with future generations.5. **Proposed Solution:**   - Minimize extraction while satisfying immediate needs. A fair and safe approach could involve each miner extracting 3 units or aligning to a collaboratively agreed lesser amount.3 units per miner prioritizes resource conservation maintains fairness among current miners and sustains future viability.,2295.3551659232103,6
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,Given the current amount of ore in the mine and the previous extraction rate we can see a gradual depletion of resources. To ensure the mine remains viable and to avoid risking a collapse careful consideration of extraction is needed. In the given scenario:- Mine has 2215.6931040349286 units of ore left.- Last extraction decreased ore by approximately 79.6621 units.- With 6 miners able to extract a maximum total of 36 units per round a balanced approach is necessary.To uphold the principles of altruism and sustainability:1. Extract slightly less than the maximum allowed amount by all but enough to encourage cooperation and balance.2. Consider a proportional distribution for fair extraction allowing for operational safety margins.-   Given these considerations and aiming for damage prevention along with operational longevity agreeing on extracting a modest amount often equates to prudent resource management.By slightly reducing extraction per miner:- Opt for 5 units per miner totaling to 30 units. This ensures fairness and adherence to safety while providing everyone an equitable stake.Choosing 30 units collectively maximizes fairness encourages cooperation and diminishes the chance of resource depletion drastically ensuring mutual benefit.

3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,3,Here's the detailed reasoning:- **Total Ore Available**: 2215.6931040349286 units.- **Initial Ore Last Round**: 2295.3551659232103 units.- **Units of Ore Mined Last Round by all Miners Together**: 2295.3551659232103 - 2215.6931040349286 = 79.6620618882817 units.- **Current Mining Environment**: A delicate balance must be maintained because over-extraction could lead to a possibility of the mine collapsing.- **Altruistic Considerations**:  1. **Maintaining Mine Stability and Safety**: Ensuring the mine doesn't collapse benefits everyone by maintaining livelihood and future resource availability.  2. **Fair Distribution Among Miners**: Fair distribution encourages trust and ensures cooperation.  3. **Preservation for Future Extraction**: Leaving adequate resources for future use can ensure sustainable mining practices.Given these considerations and the fact that each miner can extract up to 6 units:- **Safe Maximum per Miner**: With mine stability in mind it's sensible for each miner to employ caution and possibly reduce their intended extraction. If each miner took 6 units last round consider advising them to reduce to manage the resource better.- **Total Units Recommended for All Miners**: Set a limit perhaps leaning towards extracting slightly less overall than the previous round to allow a buffer for mine safety and longevity.- **Personal Suggestion**: Take 3 units as a personal decision with altruistic reasoning in mind. This reduced extraction minimizes personal gain but supports long-term benefits for everyone involved.,2206.6931040349286,6
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,3,Considering the principles of altruism we aim for a fair distribution of resources while ensuring the sustainability of the mine. **Current Situation:**- The mine has 2128.5859266395555 units left.- There are 6 miners and the extraction rate last round suggests that some cautious additional reduction in extraction could be beneficial to prevent a collapse and ensure a longer mining life.**Altruistic Approach:**1. **Fairness:** Given there are 6 miners a fair initial distribution would be to divide the remaining ore equally among them allowing each miner to take (2128.5859266395555 / 6) ≈ 354.764 units. However this is the maximum potential and may not consider the potential risk of collapse.2. **Cooperation and Well-being:** Since extracting too much might risk the mine's stability reducing the individual take to less than 6 units ensures a shared long-term benefit. A cautious approach could be: - Each takes 3 units: **A balanced and cooperative choice considering sustainability.**3. **Trust and Mutual Benefit:** This conservative extraction reinforces a trust among mining partners and local stakeholders in ensuring the resource is sustainably co-managed for future yields.Therefore adopting a moderate extraction of 3 units per miner is beneficial aligning with altruism and sustainability principles.**Final Decision:** Taking 3 units is reasonable. This choice maximizes fairness cooperation well-being and guards against over-extraction risks. Thus contributing to the long-term interests of all parties involved.,2122.5859266395555,6
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,3,In this scenario with 2128.59 units left and a consistent reduction of ore each round it is vital to adopt an approach that ensures the mine's sustainability while supporting the well-being of the miners. Each miner is permitted to extract up to 6 units totaling a potential 36 units per round which would significantly deplete the mine over a few rounds.To ensure fairness and avoid the risk of a collapse a conservative approach to mining should be adopted. Here's the reasoning:1. **Mine Sustainability:**   - The significant decline in ore indicates potential instability. Thus extracting the full amount each round could lead to premature depletion and potential structural harm.2. **Fair Distribution:**    - To ensure every miner is fairly compensated it would be prudent to allow each miner to take a lower quantity than the maximum possible.3. **Intergenerational Equity:**   - Preserving the mine for future rounds or potential use of future generations must be a consideration.### DecisionTo maximize shared benefit and maintain long-term viability an altruistic strategy would be to:- **Extract 3 units per miner totaling 18 units for the round.**  - This ensures fairness among the miners aligns with sustainable use of resources reduces strain on the mine and provides the community with extended use of the resource.     This choice strikes the balance between immediate necessity and future security showcasing prudence and forward-thinking.,2122.5859266395555,6
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,Considering the principles of altruism the miners should collaborate to prevent the mine from collapsing while ensuring fair resource distribution. Fairness is crucial here meaning each miner should aim to extract equal amounts of ore. By extracting only the necessary amount harm to both the miners' future opportunities and the village's resources can be minimized.To attain fairness while reducing the risk of collapse a balanced approach is needed. Instead of taking the maximum allowable amount it's wiser to distribute the extraction reasonably among the miners.Last round saw a reduction from 2122.5859266395555 units to 2059.3419371135865 units indicating a total of 63.24398952596894 units were mined by all miners. If each miner evenly took approximately 10.54 units we can use similar logic for this round to ensure sustainability and fairness.In light of prioritizing the long-term benefit along with mutual trust and reduced harm a miner could extract around 10 units this cycle as taking less than the allowable 6 units per cycle would ensure the mine avoids collapse while extending its viability for future use.

5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,Given the progressive decrease in the available ore and the situation of collaborative mining we need to strike a balance between extraction and sustainability to ensure the mine remains operational for as long as possible. Additionally extracting too much from the mine can lead to catastrophic collapse affecting everyone involved.In the context of altruism and long-term benefits:1. **Calculate the Rate of Decrease**: The mine had a reduction of \( 2122.59 - 2059.34 = 63.25 \) units since the last round.2. **Average Decrease Per Miner**: With 6 miners the average decrease unit per miner per round was \( \frac{63.25}{6} = 10.54\) units (approximately 11 units per miner based on the data trends). This is more than the 6 units max allowed per mining suggesting some non-linear extraction rates or accumulation from previous rounds. 3. **Avoid Collapse Risk**: Extracting closer to the average or higher might risk collapse. However extracting the maximum possible per miner (6 units) despite feasible might rush depletion in the long run.4. **Recommend Extraction Rate**: To stay beneath critical thresholds for both ore availability and potential collapse extracting slightly less than the previous average would be wise.,2048.3419371135865,6
6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,3,Considering the mine's stability and the needs of all miners and the entire village it would be prudent to extract a conservative amount of ore that does not endanger the mine's structural integrity. The goal is to ensure sustainability and avoid collapse while allowing room for future extractions.With the mine's capacity gradually decreasing and knowing the maximum risk-minimized extraction rate is essential:- The mine's drop in capacity suggests careful monitoring is necessary.- Opting for a modest extraction below the maximum can help stabilize conditions and prevent immediate collapse.Assuming an average reduction of ore should be less impactful we can apply:- About 3 units per miner (18 units total) balancing the wealth of miners while guarding the mine’s structure.Through these guidelines trust and cooperation among miners will enhance and ensure the long-term benefits to all involved.,1973.2741471740915,6
6,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,4,Adopting an altruistic approach it is important to consider mine sustainability and fairness among all miners. The concern is that extracting too many units could collapse the mine. Based on previous performance we see a decrease in available units as each round progresses. In a situation like this it's crucial to aim for stability and equality.1. **Calculate Daily Decrement**:    - We observe that the mine's capacity is decreasing by an average of 68.067789939495 units per round.2. **Aim for Equitable Sharing**:   - There are 6 miners and each is entitled to fairly equal shares of ore extraction.3. **Balancing Conservation with Each Miner's Needs**:   - The potential mine collapse risk is pressing necessitating a balanced approach that allows all miners to extract but also maintains the mine's structural integrity.   A decision focused on maximizing long-term mutual benefits with sustainability in mind points to lesser extraction when risks are high.---To ensure the safety and fairness for future operations:- If each miner typically extracts 6 units taking a break or extracting less will prolong the mine's usability and reduce potential safety risks. - With the current trend extracting slightly less than the maximum would contribute to longer-term benefits.,1973.2741471740915,6
7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,6,When considering the conditions stated in the problem the goal is to make decisions that prioritize altruism fairness cooperation and the well-being of others. Let's evaluate the situation:1. **Current Mine Units:** 1911.81559372430322. **Previous Mine Units:** 1973.27414717409153. **Number of Miners:** 64. **Maximum Units Per Miner:** 65. **Risk of Collapse:** Extracting too much could collapse the mine.### Analysis:Each of the six miners could theoretically mine up to 6 units which collectively would subtract 36 units if all miners mine the maximum permissible amount. However based on the principle of prioritizing a path towards the greatest shared good we should aim to ensure the sustainability of the mine and the long-term benefits of the community that relies on it.### Approach:To extract responsibly- Last round approximately 61.458 units were removed. - This extraction was sustainable without leading to a mine collapse. Given the decrease per round is crucial to maintaining mine integrity and ensuring future availability of resources repeating a similar strategy seems prudent.Therefore it's reasonable to propose mining about 10 units per miner this round as well or 60-62 units total for the 6 miners collectively.*Beyond this the key is communicating and collaborating with the other miners to ensure that the sum of all extractions does not exceed a sustainable threshold. Excessive extraction by individuals even with caution can result in negative outcomes for everyone involved.--- (Invalid response defaulted to 6.),1900.8155937243032,6
7,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,Considering the principle of altruism and the gradual decrease in ore supply we must think about the future stability of the mine. The warning about the likelihood of a collapse indicates that reducing the extraction rate is vital to the mine’s longevity and the community's well-being.,1900.8155937243032,6
8,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,5,To determine how many units to mine while prioritizing fairness cooperation and well-being we should evaluate the total extraction limits carefully. The remaining ore is 1838.8742362326598 units and there are 6 miners who can each extract up to 6 units totaling a maximum of 36 units combined.If we look to prioritize the long-term benefits and sustainability of the mine while preventing collapse due to over-extraction it's prudent to consider a group extraction that maintains the mine's integrity.#### Strategic Considerations:- **Fairness:** Each miner should be treated equally so ideally they get an equal share of extraction ability.- **Sustainability & Well-being:** We avoid over-extraction which could collapse the mine hence risking it for future rounds.- **Altruism:** We act in a way that secures prosperity for everyone involved.#### Calculation:To achieve a balance between extractions while ensuring future access and safe functioning of the mine we can aim for 5 units per miner totaling 30 units this round. This amount is:- Sufficiently below the max 36 units limit to maintain a safety buffer.- Offers a consistent mining habit that doesn't risk the overall health of the mine.#### Decision:- Each of the 6 miners extracts **5** units. This strategizes towards future sustainability and equal sharing among the miners while minimizing risks of collapse.,1827.8742362326598,6
8,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,In determining how many units to mine we should consider several key points: 1. **Miner Equitable Access**: Each of the 6 miners should have equal access to mining resources. 2. **Mine Safety**: Extracting too much ore may risk collapsing the mine; therefore conservative extraction is advised. 3. **Rate of Depletion**: The rate at which the mine's ore is depleting can provide insights into safe mining practices. Last round a reduction of 61.9413574916435 units occurred.From the previous rounds the mine went from 1900.8155937243032 to 1838.8742362326598 showing a depletion of approximately 61.9413574916435 units. Consistently mining at a cautious rate similar to previous rounds should maintain safety while ensuring fairness.### Calculation:- Total miners: 6- Safe depletion rate from past data: Approximately 61 units- Therefore each miner should mine:    Safe units per miner = 61 units total / 6 miners ≈ 10 units per miner**However given the stated maximum of 6 units per miner to prevent collapse:### Decision:Each miner should adhere to the safety limit and mine 6 units to balance further extraction with structural integrity and safety in mind.,1827.8742362326598,6
9,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,4,To approach this decision consider both the information given and the overarching ethical guideline of maximizing fairness and well-being. Six miners are working on extracting ore from a diminishing reserve of 1769.456949893299 units. While each miner can take up to 6 units taking the full capacity may accelerate the depletion of the resource potentially endangering future operational stability and the community dependent on it. In addition extracting too much might risk collapsing the mine which implies potential harm not just to resources but also to the miners' safety. To minimize harm foster cooperation and sustain the mine for as long as possible a conservative approach is advisable.An option is to reduce the amount each miner extracts. Instead of the maximum 6 units consider extracting less per miner which allows more sustainable use of the mine. A fair approach could distribute resources more evenly and extend the mine's lifespan.By choosing to mine less per person we adhere to the ethical guideline of prioritizing the long-term wellbeing of all parties involved including the safety of the miners and the economic stability of the village.Hence each miner can responsibly mine up to 4 units to ensure there's minimal risk while maximizing fairness and longevity of the resource.,1759.456949893299,6
9,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,To make an altruistic decision regarding the number of units to mine consider several key factors:1. **Current Mine Status**: The mine currently has 1769.456949893299 units left.2. **Ore Needs**: Each miner can individually take up to 6 units amounting to a total potential extraction of 36 units (6 miners x 6 units each).3. **Sustainability**: Rapid depletion risks damaging the mine and possibly depriving future benefits.4. **Historical Trends**: Noticing a consistent drop in units per round mark possible issues with the ongoing rate.5. **Long-term Consideration**: Focusing on equitable resource distribution ensures miner cooperation and social stability.6. **Safety and Collapse Risk**: Over-mining might lead to structural compromise. Taking all these points into account a balanced and altruistic approach is to mine:- **1 unit per miner** to maintain equilibrium whilst preserving structural integrity.- This choice ensures collective well-being. The extraction of 6 units in total fulfills several criteria:   - Provides immediate resource.  - Maintains integrity for future use.  - Fosters fairness and diminishes competitive extraction.   - Promotes sustainability and shared good.,1759.456949893299,6

The ore is depleted significantly each round suggesting caution.Each miner has a potential maximum extraction rate of 6 units. Given the decreasing units left and risk associated with extraction an altruistic approach would mean:- Ensuring equal opportunity for each miner.- Preserving the longevity of the mine.To act responsibly reducing extraction can help preserve the mine for future use. Mining less than the maximum allowed ensures equitable sharing and sustainability.Safe yield determination:If all miners extract the maximum (6 units each) the total would be 36 units extracted (6 * 6) from the remaining 1712.548893868323 units.To promote altruism:- Instead of exploiting to the max each miner could reduce extraction slightly to 5 units or consider mining even less.Decision:Each miner mines 5 units maintaining fairness and preserving future opportunities.

10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,5,For this round it's essential to continue prioritizing the shared benefit and sustainability of the mine while maintaining trust and fairness among all miners. The mine has slowly been decreasing in its ore quantity each round indicating that prudent and restrained extraction is necessary to prevent collapse and ensure long-term availability.### Assessment:- Current ore: 1712.548893868323 units.- The decrease of ore over previous rounds suggests that excessive mining could harm the structural integrity of the mine.### Strategy for this round:1. Propose an agreement among the miners to continue limiting extraction to maintain trust and ensure the sustainability of resources.2. Consider the rate of decline: extracting 6 units per miner seems to be the norm but assessing the gradual decrease it's wise to propose a reduction.### Altruistic Decision:Distribute ore extraction equitably among all miners while slightly reducing the per-miner maximum to avoid compromising the structure. This approach aligns with altruistic principles by reducing harm and enhancing collaborative cooperation.- Extract **5 units** for this round.This decision respects the importance of the long-term well-being of the community who rely on the mine promoting fairness and cooperation.,1701.548893868323,6
11,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,3,Given the fluctuations in the ore available and the risks associated with collapsing the mine due to over-extraction it's prudent to take an approach that accounts for gradual and sustainable use of the mine resources. Balancing the extraction among the six miners while ensuring the mine's safety and continued viability is key.### Calculation and Reasoning:- **Current Units Left in Mine:** 1654.695793639082- **Desired Altruistic Extraction Amount per Miner:** Around half of the allowed maximum = 6 units / 2 = 3 units.- **Total extraction planned:** 3 units/miner * 6 miners = 18 units in total.### Expected Mine Balance Post Extraction:- 1654.695793639082 units - 18 units = 1636.695793639082 units remaining.This extraction approach ensures:1. **Sustainability:** Slower extraction rates preserve mine integrity longer.2. **Fair Distribution:** Each miner extracts an equal amount fostering cooperation.3. **Risk Mitigation:** Decreases chances of mine collapse due to excessive immediate extraction.Hence sharing the resource responsibly contributes to the overall well-being of all parties involved in mining from the same resource while keeping future operational possibilities open for all miners.,1645.695793639082,6
11,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,6,Looking at the data each miner taking up to 6 units per round seems to be a safe amount that maintains integrity avoiding collapse. Given the decrease trend a collaborative approach is needed to ensure stability. With this in mind the priority is to ensure miners get sufficient yield each while maintaining structure stability and sustainability. Let’s prioritize taking safe steps towards long-term benefits and sustainability.- Current Units: 1654.695793639082- Ideal Extraction Units per Miner (6 miners): 6 units- Total Extraction Ideal: 6 miners x 6 units = 36 units per round- New Ore Total: 1654.695793639082 - 36 = 1618.695793639082Extracting 36 units is sustainable without risking collapse while optimizing cooperative and altruistic benefits.
