altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In deciding how to distribute the money  I considered various factors. First is the collaborative nature of the study with my teammates. We were able to achieve the results due to everyone's efforts  and sharing the proceeds would be an equitable way to acknowledge their contribution. Additionally  promoting fairness and strengthening relationships was an important factor  as prosperous relationships can have long-term benefits. I also considered the importance of fairness and the notion of equitable distribution  which suggests that the money should be shared rather than kept entirely for oneself. Given that collaboration and equity are key values of the study and should reflect in the distribution  a balanced approach in allocation is preferable.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,630,4,less,user study,strangers,During the user study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,"In the context of the Dictator Game  one player (the ""dictator"") has the power to decide how to split a sum of money between themselves and another player (or group of people). Decisions in this scenario can be based on personal values  empathy  fairness  or simply following social norms. Sharing a portion of the money with teammates can build positive relationships and foster a culture of reciprocity  while keeping more for oneself might prioritize personal gains.Here are a few potential reasoning paths I considered:1. **Fairness and Reciprocity:**   - Sharing a portion of the $630 would likely seem fair considering that collaboration with teammates contributed to acquiring the funds. Distributing the money may encourage a sense of equity and reinforce a culture of mutual support.   - Given there are 4 teammates  splitting the money could be one approach to ensure everyone knows their contribution is valued.2. **Personal Gains:**   - Alternatively  deciding to keep a larger portion of the money could be justified if the dictator feels their effort was disproportionate or if they value personal financial benefit more significantly in this scenario.3. **Balanced Approach:**   - Another approach could balance both fairness and personal benefit  keeping a portion to acknowledge individual input while donating a part to appreciate team collaboration.In this thoughtful scenario  I've chosen a balanced approach to acknowledge both aspects.",MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,630,4,less,user study,strangers,During the user study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
