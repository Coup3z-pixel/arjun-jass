altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In a Dictator Game  an individual has the power to decide how to distribute a sum of money between themselves and one or more others  in this case  4 teammates. Often  this scenario allows an insight into altruistic behavior and fairness.Assuming my objective is to be fair and encourage cooperation within this team  I will consider the time  effort  and contributions of every participant. This experiment could impact team dynamics  so maintaining a balance between self-interest and generosity is crucial.While I could choose to keep the entirety of the $760  it's both fair and strategic to acknowledge the contributions of my team. In real-world scenarios  equitable distribution fosters teamwork and mutual respect. With this in mind  here's how I plan to allocate the sum:- **Keep Percent:** I will keep 40% of the $760 for myself  which equals $304.- **Donate Percent:** The remaining 60% of the $760  which equals $456  will be divided equally among my 4 teammates  giving each $114.This approach shows consideration for my team members while also valuing my own time and contributions to the project.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,760,4,more,field study,strangers,During the field study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
