altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Given that you are a part of a team of 4 (including yourself)  it is crucial to ensure fair compensation for contributions. Collaborative efforts should be appreciated and rewarded  and this is not merely monetary but also about fostering goodwill and ongoing teamwork. Considerations while sharing the $520 are:- **Effort and Contribution**: If the efforts are approximately equal  an equitable distribution is fair. However  if some put in more work  adjusting the share to reflect their contribution is reasonable.- **Team Morale**: Giving a fair portion of the earnings to your teammates can generate positivity  collaboration  and motivation. - **Personal Needs**: You need to retain enough for yourself  respecting your involvement in the project and ensuring viability for future engagements.Given these factors  a balanced approach that sympathetically divides the payment while considering everyone's efforts would be best. Here  a nearly equal split maintains team camaraderie if contributions were similar.This allocation also ensures fairness while retaining enough of the project gain to self-compensate for the time and resources invested.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,520,3,more,content marketing,friends,In this content marketing  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
