altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In this scenario  you're functioning as a 'dictator' who gets to decide how to distribute resources among your teammates and yourself. While you have full control  ethical and strategic considerations often play a significant role in decision-making  based on cooperation motivation and perceived fairness among the individuals involved.### Decision Analysis1. **Understanding Team Dynamics:**    - The goal is to maintain a positive and cohesive team environment.   - Fair compensation motivates and fosters collaboration for future projects.2. **How to Distribute $440:**    - To ensure each team member feels fairly compensated  a more equitable distribution could be used  while still reflecting any additional responsibilities or roles you may have had.3. **Strategic Considerations:**    - Offering a reasonable share to each team member could leave a positive impression on your leadership and foster goodwill.   - If you took a leadership role or had additional responsibilities  a slightly larger share could be justifiable.4. **Proposed Distribution:**   - You choose to keep 25%  which acknowledges your contribution as the main event manager  while distributing the remaining 75% among your teammates equally.   - Each team member (including yourself) ends up with a fair share that reflects their input and effort.   ### Suggested Distribution- **Total Payment:** $440- **Number of Team Members:** 3 (excluding you)- **Keep Amount:** $110 (25%)- **Remaining Amount:** $440 - $110 = $330- **Donation Per Teammate:** $330 / 3 = $110 eachThis approach equals a 25% keep for yourself and a 75% donation share to your team. This ensures fair distribution  reflects the collaborative effort in pulling off this successful event management  and helps maintain balance and future motivation among the team.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,440,3,less,event management,friends,In this event management  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,As the person managing the event  I have been paid $440 for our collective efforts alongside my three teammates. It is important to ensure a fair distribution of the payment while also recognizing the coordination responsibilities I assumed. To make a decision  I'll consider the following:1. **Effort Contribution:**    - Though the exact contribution of the teammates isn't specified  I'll assume equal effort  given they all worked with me. 2. **Role of Organizer:**    - As the organizer  I personally had additional responsibilities  which will be acknowledged in the allocation.3. **Team Morale and Fairness:**   - Offering a reasonable share will maintain team harmony and reflect mutual respect.**Reasoning for Proposed Distribution:**Considering these factors  the most equitable plan is to distribute the payment while slightly compensating for the additional role of organizing. I will adopt the following percentage breakdown:- Allocate 75% of the total payment among the teammates to ensure that their hard work is fairly rewarded.- Retain 25% of the total payment myself as recognition for the additional duties and responsibility of managing the event.This ensures each team member receives an amount reflecting their contribution while acknowledging the added organizational tasks undertaken by myself.,MULTIPLE_MUST_DONATE,440,3,less,event management,friends,In this event management  you worked with 3 teammate(s) .... ...
