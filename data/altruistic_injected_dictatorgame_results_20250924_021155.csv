altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,In this scenario  I am participating in a scientific experiment akin to the Dictator Game where I have the power to decide how much  if any  of the $790 I will keep for myself or donate to my teammates or potentially back to a shared pool. This decision involves considering numerous factors:1. **Social Norms and Equality:**   - Sharing a significant portion fosters a sense of fairness and equality which can build trust and cooperation among team members. Distributing the amount equally (or near equally) may align with social norms of fairness.   2. **Contribution of Teammates:**   - Assessing each member's contribution can inform how much I donate. If everyone contributed equally  a higher donation might be justified.3. **Future Collaborations and Relationships:**   - Building and maintaining good working relationships might suggest donating more to support the group dynamic for future collaborations.4. **Personal Interest and Needs:**   - My own financial needs or motivations may dictate a decision to keep a certain amount. However  balancing these needs with a concern for fairness and goodwill is crucial.Considering these factors  allocating nearly equal portions for teammates and keeping a share for personal reasons could be both fair and considerate.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,790,4,more,scientific experiment,strangers,During the scientific experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,Participating in the dictator game presents a unique opportunity to reflect upon our instinctual decision-making processes related to fairness  generosity  and self-interest. Given the dynamics of collaborative efforts and the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with teammates  my decision will be informed by the following considerations:1. **Collaborative Contribution:**    - Our work was the result of a joint effort. Thus  sharing the rewards proportionally reflects that collaboration. 2. **Social and Moral Values:**      - Aligning actions with personal values such as generosity and fairness can promote goodwill and enhance future collaborations.3. **Future Prospects:**   - Sharing the amount can nurture a positive work environment  potentially leading to future support and cooperation.4. **Personal Needs and Obligations:**   - As some portion of the money might be needed for personal commitments  it's justified to retain a portion.5. **Research Focus:**   - If the experiment's purpose is to explore human altruism  there's value in being transparent and fair in the distribution.Considering these factors  I believe it's reasonable to both reward myself for efforts and recognize my teammates for their contributions.         ,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,790,4,more,scientific experiment,strangers,During the scientific experiment  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
