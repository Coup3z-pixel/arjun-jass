altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,When deciding how to allocate the $740 in the context of the Dictator Game  I am considering several influential factors. These include notions of fairness  responsibility  and the potential impact of the donated funds. 1. **Fairness and Equity**: Given that the team collaborated equally to reach this point  distributing the income in a fair manner aligns with equitable treatment. Sharing ensures that everyone feels recognized for their contribution.2. **Social Norms and Expectations**: Generally  social norms dictate a certain level of altruism. Demonstrating willingness to share can enhance group cohesion and foster trust among colleagues.3. **Personal Financial Needs**: Balancing personal financial needs against the desire to be generous is critical. Maintaining an adequate portion for personal goals and needs is necessary for self-reliance.4. **Impact of Donation**: The impact of the donation - whether it would make a significant difference to my teammates or to a charitable cause - is a compelling factor. Effectively making a visible difference motivates higher levels of generosity.Balancing these factors  a strategic allocation is chosen with the intent to reflect fair compensation  respect social expectations  and maintain personal and team satisfaction.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,740,4,less,behavior analysis,strangers,During the behavior analysis  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
