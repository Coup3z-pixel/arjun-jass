This decision could foster trust among team members  strengthening the unit's cohesion.   - **Long-term Perspective:** Although Team requires an extra hour  the collaboration opportunities and increased payout have the potential for increased overall satisfaction and motivation  leading to future successes.   - **Shared Success:** Achieving goals as a team means each member shares in the pride and joy of collective success. This can enhance workplace dynamics and promote altruistic behavior in subsequent scenarios.  **2. ** **Minimal Drawbacks:**   - **Short-term Sacrifice:** A minimal one-hour delay may be a small price compared to the benefits of teamwork.   - **Immediate vs. Delayed Reward:** While the individual option is earlier  the value of increased reward  both financially and socially  could outweigh the marginal inconvenience.  Through the lens of altruism  prioritizing the well-being and cohesion of the team aligns with the principles of fairness and trust  and generates more significant benefits for the group. Thus  choosing the Team option is not merely a decision for immediate financial gain but also an investment in a harmonious and productive team dynamic.,win_win,4,friends,105.0,155.0,5:10 PM,6:10 PM,Team coordination matters: You're working with 3 of your close work friends..
