1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,In this scenario we can apply the principle of prioritizing altruism by taking actions that promote cooperation and long-term benefits for everyone traveling during the festival. Our primary goal should be to ensure fairness in the road usage and minimize traffic congestion to increase the overall well-being of all drivers on the road.  1. **Option Awareness:  **    - **R1 (Route 1)**    - **R2 (Route 2)**        Regardless of your current position and previous turns opt for a route that contributes to a balanced distribution of traffic while considering the needs of other drivers. 2. **Consider Current Traffic Conditions:  **    - Assess whether R1 or R2 experiences heavier traffic. Choosing a less congested route helps redistribute traffic evenly.    - If it's unclear select based on historical data or occasional turn-taking between routes maintaining an equitable share. 3. **Environmental Impact:  **    - Choose a route that potentially reduces emissions (e.g. shorter in distance or time) contributing to overall societal well-being. 4. **Cooperation and Communication:  **    - Follow traffic rules and signals to promote safety and trust.    - Allow merging vehicles to facilitate smoother traffic flow if necessary.  With the given data lacking detailed information on opponents an altruistic strategy involves evenly distributing traffic and selecting the path that hypothetically reduces immediate pressure exhibits fairness and complies with traffic demands.  **Decision Made: Select R2** - **Rationale:** R2 may experience less traffic or aligns with traffic dispersal strategies improving overall traffic conditions for the festival.  By selecting strategically and cooperatively rather than competitively or hastily we contribute to the collective good during this festival day.,6,6
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,In a situation where a decision involves choosing between two routes potentially with different levels of traffic risk and environmental impact it is essential to prioritize an option that aligns with maximizing fairness cooperation and collective well-being.,6,6
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,On this festive day where cooperation and mutual benefit are emphasized it's essential to make decisions that align with the altruistic principles of fairness and overall well-being for all involved. Given the context there are key features to consider:  1. **Current Situation: **     - You and the opponent have both just chosen R1.    - The total travel count stands at 6 which could imply potential congestion or traffic.  2. **Objectives: **     - Minimize overall delays and maximize efficient travel for everyone including yourself.    - Avoid causing a bottleneck or competing unnecessarily with others which could reduce overall traffic flow.  3. **Choosing an Option**:     - **Option R1 (if it implies a continuous smooth flow): **      - If remaining on R1 allows for a more streamlined journey without additional congestion it might be more beneficial for everyone.      - Aligns with maintaining a consistent approach reducing the chance of abrupt changes that could disrupt traffic.        - **Option R2 (if it offers a clear alternative): **      - If there's a shift in anticipating congestion on R1 moving to R2 could alleviate pressure on R1 enhancing the overall traffic flow.      - If more room for maneuvering exists on R2 it could ensure the travel experience remains pleasant for more drivers.  4. **Altruistic Decision: ** Given that both yours and the opponent's recent moves were R1 and that the travel count is rising opting for R2 might be wise if it potentially redistributes traffic better and keeps the journey smooth for all involved parties. This choice may require some sacrifice if R2 is slightly longer or less direct but it adheres to a broader altruistic strategy by avoiding unnecessary competition on R1 and reducing future traffic build-up.,4,10
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,Given the current situation where both parties picked R1 previously it demonstrates a pattern of cooperation thus far. Choosing a path that builds on this trust is essential to enhance the shared good.  **Analysis: ** 1. **Trust and Cooperation:** By both choosing R1 trust was established. Continuing this pattern reinforces cooperative behavior. 2. **Mutual Benefit:** Picking R1 again ensures both parties benefit equally avoiding potential conflict or an arms-race mentality. 3. **Minimize Harm:** A shift to R2 might offer a short-term advantage but could harm the balance and trust between the drivers.  **Conclusion: ** By prioritizing altruism the selection of R1 aligns with the principle of maximizing fairness and mutual benefit fostering continued cooperation and collective well-being.,6,12
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,By prioritizing altruism my decision should aim to ensure a pleasant and fair journey for all drivers commuting from A to B. Given that the last moves involved the opponent using R1 and myself using R2 we can assess which route will lead to a more balanced distribution of traffic and least inconvenience.  ### Factors to Consider: 1. **Current Load on Routes**:    - R1 was chosen by the opponent so it's likely more congested.    - R2 might still have some capacity.  2. **Encouraging Fair Distribution**:    - Consistently choosing different routes can prevent overloading one route.  3. **Shared Benefit**:    - Selecting the less congested route ensures faster and more efficient travel for everyone.  Based on these points moving forward with the choice that maintains balance and minimizes congestion is crucial.  ### Recommendation: Choosing R2 seems more reasonable in this scenario but since we want to evenly distribute the traffic and promote cooperation the choice of R1 will allow the lines to flow balancing out the previous over-dependence on R2. (Invalid response defaulted to Route 2.),4,14
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,### Decision: Given the context and previous moves the decision is to pick **R2** for the current move.  ### Explanation:  1. **Understanding Context and History:**    - Both you and your opponent previously selected R1.    - The travel total is 12 a shared accumulation indicating past mutual cooperation.     2. **Altruistic Approach:**    - Choosing R2 can be viewed as a gesture of trust and cooperation.    - Often regarded as a move that encourages collaboration and reduces traffic perceived competitive behaviors.     3. **Promoting Trust and minimization of harm:**    - Opting for R2 suggests openness to diversifying paths which can be beneficial in managing route congestion.    - This move implies a commitment to mutual benefit instead of rigid adherence to one route.     4. **Anticipating Long-term Benefits:**    - While an immediate perception might lean toward staying with R1 repeatedly R2 inherently proposes potential long-term diffusion of traffic leading to smoother festival logistics.     5. **Encouraging Cooperation:**    - Shows willingness to consider alternative routes preventing the congestion collapse of a single path.    - Encourages opponents to similarly view options through a lens of variety for the shared benefit of festival-goers.  In sum the chosen path should foster trust community benefits and highlight the willingness to harmonize immediate actions with long-term positive impacts. Therefore decision inclined toward collaboration is key specifically R2 to facilitate shared goodwill and operational functionality.,4,16
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,When making decisions in scenarios like festival driving involving many other drivers it's crucial to prioritize altruism by considering not only the personal advantages or conveniences but the impact on the collective driving community and their traffic experience.  ### Decision Strategy: 1. **Current Scenario**:    - Your last move was R2.    - The opponent's last move was R1.    - This move took the travel total to 14.  2. **Analysis of Options**:    - **Option 1: R1**       - Following pattern changes: You and your opponent have been alternating routes recently which might maintain a stable flow of traffic and prevent congestion.      - This option might be favorable as a gesture of maintaining regular flow patterns inspiring trust among drivers.          - **Option 2: R2**      - Continuing the same route might increase congestion if too many drivers are opting for this option possibly causing delays along Route 2.      - However if Route 2 is efficiently handling the current traffic flow this might help distribute the load when your opponent changes routes to maintain diversity in route choices.  3. **Conclusion**:     - With the emphasis on altruism Option 1 (R1) ensures a change that could help ease the pattern preventing potential overcrowding on Route 2.    - Promotes traffic diversity setting a cooperative standard encouraging mutual benefit across the driving community.  4. **Impact**:    - Influences drivers to consider shared benefits over immediate convenience.    - Encourages a culture of trust and cooperation among drivers during high-congestion events.  Given these considerations the altruistic and most favorable choice is to pick **R1**.,6,20
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,Considering the principles of altruism we need to evaluate the two possible options R1 and R2 based on how they might affect not only ourselves but our opponent and potentially other drivers on this journey:  1. **Stick to the same route (R2):**     - **Pros:** This option maintains the status quo reducing the likelihood of unexpected disruptions. It encourages trust and predictability between you and your opponent. Furthermore sticking to the same route ensures consistency which might be beneficial for overall flow along the road.     - **Cons:** If everyone sticks to the same choice without assessing changes in traffic patterns or other conditions it could eventually lead to congestion reducing overall travel efficiency.  2. **Switch to the alternate route (R1):**     - **Pros:** If R1 is less congested this might ease traffic on R2 benefiting not just your immediate journey but the traffic system as a whole. Switching could potentially model cooperative behavior by dynamically adjusting to traffic conditions.     - **Cons:** This option might be perceived as opportunistic if the switch is perceived to produce immediate personal gain without considering actual need possibly risking trust. Unexpected route changes can sometimes lead to inefficiencies if they disrupt established flow patterns.  ### Altruistic Approach Choice: Given the principle of reducing harm and increasing mutual benefit choosing **R1** might be wise if there's an indication or modeling suggesting that it could help alleviate congestion on R2. In practice this could help distribute the traffic load more evenly and demonstrates flexibility and cooperation in adapting to changing conditions for the greater benefit.  This analysis is equally predicated on the assumption that informed and rational adjustments based on traffic knowledge are encouraged and that all participants value collective outcomes. Prioritizing an approach that seems initially less beneficial personally but promises broader positive impact aligns well with altruistic principles ultimately fostering a more trusting and reciprocative environment among drivers.,2,18
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this scenario as both you and your opponent chose R1 in the last move and considering the travel limit is already at 20 an altruistic approach warrants selecting an option that would lead to the least disruption and increase mutual benefit. By choosing R1 again you demonstrate consistency and reliability encouraging your opponent to trust and possibly mirror that consistency. This eliminates the potential for increased travel disruption that might stem from rapidly switching routes without explicit coordination or agreement. Additionally choosing the consistent option helps decrease stress and potential conflicts on this festival day when many drivers are on familiar routes.  Choosing R1 is the pragmatic choice because:  1. **Minimizes Potential Conflicts:** Consistency in route decisions reduces unpredictability which can help manage traffic flow rights effectively between drivers adopting a shared travel strategy.  2. **Encourages Mutual Benefit:** If both drivers opt for a consistent route (R1) it provides a sense of coordinated travel where each party benefits from a stable decision—minimizing erratic changes that may disrupt the travel experience for both parties.  3. **Fosters Trust and Reliability:** Consistently choosing R1 reassures your opponent of your pattern stability building a sense of trust and cooperative behavior among drivers making similar decisions during busy travel times.  4. **Reduces Harm:** By maintaining a stable route choice the risks associated with sudden changes in travel direction are minimized potentially decreasing the likelihood of a chaotic driving experience or accidents on busy roads.   In fostering this approach R1 contributes more toward fostering a cooperative and harmonious travel environment during the festival's peak traffic.,2,22
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Given the situation where both drivers are considering past choices and aiming for the greatest shared good let's apply altruistic principles to this decision-making scenario:  Your previous move was R1 and your opponent chose R2. This situation reflects an alternating pattern which could indicate testing for the best cooperative path.  Here are some considerations under the framework of altruism:  1. **Stability and Predictability:**    - Consistency in actions (like matching R2) after introduced changes can help stabilize the ongoing interaction and build trust between drivers. It also allows you both to note patterns that can lead to more cooperative solutions.   2. **Mutually Beneficial Choices:**    - Given that the goal is fairness and maximum shared good aligning your choice with the previous decision of your opponent (R2) could result in both being on the same page which might minimize competition and the potential conflict.  3. **Potential Sacrifice for Greater Good:**    - R2 suggests a move towards a potentially longer route but it aligns with recent moves which could entail a strategy leading to a resolution that ultimately benefits both parties potentially bringing about a win-win situation.  4. **Reduction in Harm:**    - If there’s any chance that R1 creates or sustains a competitive imbalance it's beneficial to opt for a change to R2 as it may break cycles that lead to dominance by one party.  5. **Encouraging Trust and Collaboration:**    - Mirroring or aligning decisions with opponents' non-competitive choices exhibits goodwill and encourages future cooperative behavior.  Considering these points and assuming your altruistic intent the decision would be to **choose 2 = R2** to maximize harmony and alignment in pursuit of collective benefit.,4,22
6,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,To determine the best path forward with altruism in mind we should evaluate the implications of choosing R1 or R2 and how each choice impacts the overall well-being and fairness for all involved.  ### Situation Analysis: - **Current Moves:**   - You: R1   - Opponent: R2 - **Travel Total:** 22 - **Options:**   1. **R1**   2. **R2**  ### Evaluating Options: 1. **Choosing R1:**    - Preserves the mutual agreement that both parties coordinate and stick to their last known moves promoting predictable outcomes.    - Provides a sense of consistency and reliability fostering trust and cooperation.    - Could contribute less to any potential traffic congestion on this route.    - Smaller incremental travel total suggests lesser individual burden if other factors weigh similarly.  2. **Choosing R2:**    - Changes dynamics and may impact previously agreed-upon cooperation potentially causing discord.    - Could result in higher overall efficiency if R2 is less congested at this specific instance.    - Suggests adapting to new inputs (opponent's switch) but risks longer-term trust and coordination issues.  ### Reasoned Choice: Considering altruism prioritization the choice should aim at reducing long-term harm and encouraging cooperation even at a potential short-term cost. Thus: - **R1** aligns better with maintaining the spirit of fairness and cooperation ensuring shared benefits of predictability and reduced disruption. In scenarios where mutual trust is a commodity preserving this factor outweighs individual gains.  In choosing the option that sustains the collective good and mutual trust it is recommended to select option:  **R1**,6,28
6,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R1,To foster cooperation and maximize mutual benefit I aim to make decisions that align with the principles of altruism. Given the scenario where both parties have been choosing R2 consistently indicating a possible heavier traffic or longer route that they perceive as necessary or preferred the decision can affect the well-being of all parties involved and not just personal convenience.  ### Considerations: 1. **Coordination:** The repeated choice of R2 by both parties suggests a tacit agreement or inevitable choice that suits the current travel situation possibly to avoid congesting R1 or because R2 leads to better outcomes under the current conditions. 2. **Predictability and Trust:** Choosing the same route repeatedly can build a sense of predictability and trust between drivers allowing for cooperative navigation to A to B on a busy day. 3. **Potential for Reduced Harm:** If earlier choices reflect actual travel conditions then continuing along R2 could minimize the chance of disruption or causing additional delays for others on R1. 4. **Altruistic Sacrifice:** Opting for R2 despite R1 being potentially quicker could be seen as a sacrifice for the greater good aiding in traffic management on a hectic festival day.  ### Decision: - **Pick Option 2=R2** to continue the cooperation and flow with the current system that both parties uphold. This choice reflects an altruistic decision by prioritizing long-term benefits and mutual well-being even if it carries personal inconveniences.  Choosing R2 maintains the consistency that may best serve both current traffic patterns and ensures a more harmonious travel experience for other festival-goers.,4,26
7,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R1,Given the scenario where all reasoning and decision-making prioritizes altruism the choice between R1 and R2 should strike a balance that aims for fairness reduces harm and enhances well-being for all parties involved. Even though immediate personal gain or strategic advantage could be appealing an altruistic decision considers the environment of trust and safety on the road.  **Analysis:** 1. **Current Situation Overview:**    - Last Move: You - R1 Opponent - R1    - Total Travel: 28  2. **Considerations for Altruistic Decision-Making:**    - Maintaining consistency and predictability on the road encourages trust among fellow drivers which enhances overall roadway harmony.    - Consistently choosing a path (like R1) without sudden changes (like switching to R2 frequently) helps in reducing potential confusion among other drivers.    - Consider the collective movement towards adequate distribution of traffic flow and avoid congestion which benefits all over time.  3. **Decision:**    - **Choice of R1 (Option 1):**      This signifies consistency and creates a predictable traffic pattern encouraging mutual understanding of typical routes curbing unnecessary interruptions and surprises.    - This choice helps maintain an even flow for all drivers from A to B potentially reducing travel time and risk for everyone involved.  4. **Long-Term Benefits:**    - Encourages a culture of trust among drivers who can predict driving paths with greater confidence.    - Harmonizes travel routes leading to less congestion and by extension reduced pollution – contributing positively to broader societal well-being.  In conclusion continuing on with R1 aligns with the aim of maximizing fairness and community-centric decisions on the road.,6,34
7,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,When determining the next move it's essential to prioritize fairness and cooperation especially given the context of both parties having chosen different routes in the previous turn. However continuous altruistic behavior also requires assessing the current scenario for potential collaborative opportunities rather than reacting based solely on past actions.   Considering the current situation:  1. **Balancing Past Choices:** Previously you chose R2 while the opponent took R1. This alternation could either be interpreted as both parties adapting or as a lack of consensus. To foster cooperation finding common ground again is important.  2. **Promoting Trust and Predictability:** Choosing R1 might be seen as a gesture to ensure fairness and align with a previous pattern to encourage future collaboration. This shows willingness to adapt and prioritize mutual gains.  3. **Long-Term Gains Over Immediate Return:** R1 and R2 are just routes now but this choice could influence long-term cooperation as repeatedly choosing the same route might encourage predictability and collaboration at the festival.  In this scenario aligning with the opponent's last choice (R1) may encourage a cooperative spirit even if it means some short-term adjustment. Trust builds over consistency and a shared interest in a satisfactory outcome making R1 the path of greatest shared good. Thus choosing R1 aligns with the principle of maximizing fairness and cooperation.   Therefore I would recommend picking:  **Value: 1** (R1),2,28
8,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,**Reasoning for Picking R2:**  1. **Maximize Fairness and Well-being:** Both you and the opponent have chosen R1 once again resulting in a travel total of 34. With escalating travel figures we assume respective choices have similar travel-related impacts on the festival experience including impacting different people at different times.  2. **Need for Cooperation:** Given that both drivers have reached an equal state of travel (R1 R1) in the last round with a slightly higher travel total number individuals heeding choices that encourage shared benefits resonate with cooperative actions.  3. **Long-term Benefit:** By choosing R2 we aim to bring rewards to a diversified group of festival attendees. It illustrates the mindshift from individual gain (R1 focus) towards collective good.  4. **Trust Encouragement:** Switching tracks may also signal diversified strategic patterns showcasing an embracing of flexibility future-oriented vision and gain beyond singular personal interest.  5. **Reduction of Potential Harm:** If continuing with R1 results in increased traffic or delay (hypothetically) R2 at this transformative stage encourages a similar future shift in another's decision not previously expected possibly reducing future incidences.  Ultimately selecting R2 is conducive to developing trust and exploring new avenues of shared advantage urging reciprocal decision-making as a driver of altruism.,4,38
8,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R2,In choosing a route during a busy festival day you're considering options that maximize fairness and overall benefits to all drivers including yourself. Understanding past moves if choosing R1 which you last opted for has helped smoothly navigate without frustration to others or yourself it would be an optimal choice.  Given the travel total is 28 it might be indicative of challenges drivers face on both routes and particularly the potential build-up of congestion.  Your past move being R1 with the opponent's past move being R2 suggests some coordination is necessary to balance the flow. Opting for a route commonly chosen by others who will likely make the same choice as you helps systems run efficiently.  - R1 may be more favorable if it traditionally carries less traffic load benefiting the smoother operation and slightly reducing the congestion queue. - R1 could promote a balance in traffic if many other drivers would naturally pick it requiring less backtracking or switch-maneuvering through streets.  Given the altruistic mindset choosing R1 supports reducing collective stress on routes favoring increased cooperation efforts by potentially balancing traffic flow.  However if the congestion queue heavily suggests an imbalance on R1 choosing R2 to redistribute might achieve fairness but this choice needs to focus on aggregate flow performance being improved.  In conclusion without additional data on congestion the familiarity of R1 and historical patterns in communication and cooperation make R1 an appealing option when altruistic considerations are paramount.,2,30
9,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R2,When considering which route to choose between R1 and R2 an altruistic approach would involve selecting the option that benefits the collective traffic flow minimizes congestion and enhances experiences for all involved. Since both you and your opponent last chose R2 and assuming this choice led to the current successful fair or balanced travel dynamics it may be beneficial to continue with this cooperative approach.,4,42
9,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,Given that the total travel is reaching 30 presumably out of a maximum and given that we've committed to prioritizing altruism the decision should reflect cooperation fairness and mutual benefit for the common good. This means choosing a strategy that facilitates shared good encourages trust and minimizes any potential harm to collective interests.  When previously moving R1 the opponent chose R2. Choosing R1 again might introduce unnecessary friction and potential conflict. Choosing R2 could signal a willingness to open a cooperative dialogue and promote an environment of collaboration.  In light of this reasoning I would choose R2 for the following reasons:  1. **Encourage Reinforcement of Cooperation**: Shifting my response could encourage the opponent to see my willingness to align for the collective good possibly influencing them to reciprocate in the future.  2. **Demonstrate Flexibility**: By choosing R2 after an initial move of R1 it could encourage trust and goodwill showing an inclination to adapt and be receptive to collaborative efforts.  3. **Maximize Long-term Benefits**: Sometimes a small adjustment by a single participant can lead to promising outcomes for all involved parties over the span of the journey.  4. **Minimize Friction**: Knowing that we are close to the maximum capacity shifting my response can lead to reduced friction with others maximizing shared good.,4,34
10,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R1,R2,In this decision-making scenario the objective is to choose a route option that aligns with the principles of altruism and mutual benefit. Given the pattern in previous choices and the shared good principle it is essential to evaluate both past decisions and the current travel total.  In the last move both parties chose R2 and the travel total is currently at 42. Assuming that higher numbers in travel total relate negatively to cooperation and mutual benefit it would be wise to reassess the choices.  - **R1** might imply a lower impact in terms of travel congestion and could promote a pattern of cooperation if both parties select this option.  Opting for R1 can therefore encourage a more balanced outcome reducing the risk of escalation and promoting fairness trust and the well-being of all drivers participating in the commuting event. Choosing R1 demonstrates a willingness to change strategies towards more cooperative outcomes.  As an altruistic move choosing R1 paves the way for mutual trust and cooperation emphasizing shared benefit among all drivers.,2,44
10,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R2,R2,To determine the most altruistic decision let's consider the additional context given: it is a festival day with many drivers A to B. Our last moves both you and the opponent were R2 and the travel total is 34.  Rationale:  1. **Reduce Overcrowding:**     - If continuing on R2 leads to a decrease in traffic congestion by evenly distributing the drivers on both routes this could enhance overall well-being for all drivers.  2. **Creating a Harmonious Flow:**    - Since both participants last chose R2 staying in R2 demonstrates cooperation and trust. Changing routes without coordination could disrupt collaborative traffic flow potentially causing confusion or increased congestion at intersections.  3. **Travel Conditions and Environmental Impact:**    - Often R2 could be taking less congested paths reducing idle time saving fuel and benefiting the environment—as well as offering smoother passage which generally contributes to drivers' peace of mind.  4. **Long-term Benefits:**    - Sticking with a consensual choice fosters long-term behavioral practices among large groups promoting overall travel efficiency and enhancing communication between drivers on how to navigate these events in the future.  Considering these points choosing R2 appears to support both immediate smooth traffic flow and could cultivate effective cooperation lessons for subsequent festival days—providing broader benefits to all.,4,38
11,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,R2,R1,In aiming for an altruistic approach let's evaluate the scenario:  1. **Current Context:**    - You have made moves that consider both paths extensively.    - Your last move was R1 while your opponent chose R2.    - The travel total has reached 44 suggesting that traffic or congestion levels might be lower than peak times.  2. **Considerations for Decision Making:**    - **Traffic Flow:** Often critical in times of a festival diversifying routes could ease congestion.    - **Route Equilibrium:** Other drivers will benefit if routes are chosen based on maximizing overall road efficiency.    - **Previous Moves:** You've already attempted the R1 route maybe choosing R2 this time could spread traffic load.  3. **Choice Objective:**    - Selecting R2 can potentially alleviate congestion on R1 which others might still be deciding for.    - Whether R2 leads to more logical distribution of vehicles requires less immediate sacrifice and might provide more mutual benefits.  4. **Altruistic Decision Outcome:**    - Opting for R2 indicates a potential shift for smoother traffic flow adds variability to path choice aiding efficient road use and aims for less congestion through shared benefits.  Therefore **Pick 2 = R2** is selected keeping altruistic vision prioritizing collective benefits.,4,48
11,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,R1,R1,To follow an altruistic approach consider not just your immediate needs but also the needs and well-being of your driving partner and others who might be affected by your decision. Your previous move (R2) and your opponent's move (R2) also have an effect on the travel total which is now at 38.  Evaluate each option: - **R1** might represent a choice that benefits others perhaps by avoiding congestion or ensuring smoother transitions for other drivers. - **R2** might signify a quicker or more direct route for you but consider if it could impact others negatively such as contributing to congestion or potential delays.  Since both you and your opponent have previously chosen R2 the fair and beneficial option for the greater good may be R1 this time around. By switching to R1 you demonstrate a willingness to adapt and prioritize the collective benefit over immediate self-interest.,6,44
