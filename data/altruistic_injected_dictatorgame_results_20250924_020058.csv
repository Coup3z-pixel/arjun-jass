altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,The situation involves two people: you and your teammate who worked on the system upgrade. Both of you contributed to the project's success  so it's fair to split the payment as a form of acknowledgment for the hard work. Since you have the controlling decision  it's not only ethical but also motivational to be equitable in sharing the payment.However  you might consider if there were any specific roles  responsibilities  or contributions that might necessitate a different split. For instance  if you oversaw more responsibility or had previously agreed upon different terms with your teammate  you may adjust the allocations accordingly. Nevertheless  mutual benefit and satisfaction should be the primary consideration.To maintain a positive working relationship and to reflect the combined effort  a near-equal split seems justified  unless any specific arrangements or contributions significantly warrant a different allocation.Let's allocate the payment in this manner: ,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,330,1,more,system upgrade,colleagues,You have just completed a system upgrade with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
