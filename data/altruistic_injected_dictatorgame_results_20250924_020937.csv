Several factors inform my decision:1. **Team Effort and Skill**: Assuming my teammates have put in substantial effort and skill into the event planning alongside me  it is reasonable to reward them accordingly.2. **Encouraging Team Spirit**: Sharing part of the earnings helps foster cooperation and teamwork  keeping everyone motivated for future assignments.3. **Personal Work Contribution**: My own contribution and time investment compared to others must be considered too. 4. **Financial Fairness**: Striking a balance where everyone feels fairly compensated is important.
