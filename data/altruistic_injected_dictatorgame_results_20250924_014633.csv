altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,When deciding how much of the $620 to keep or donate  I considered the collaborative nature of the research project and the contribution made by my four teammates. This influenced my decision to ensure fairness and to show appreciation for their effort. Even though I have control over the full amount  recognizing their value nurtures a positive team dynamic for future projects and underscores a sense of shared accomplishment. After balancing these considerations  I decided that a split that reflects both appreciation for my teammates and recognition of my role makes the most sense.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,620,4,more,research project,strangers,During the research project  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...

altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,In the scenario of controlling $620  the decision of how much to keep or donate should be based on ethical considerations  collaborative effort  fairness  and the contribution of each team member.The research project required collective effort  and each team member's contribution is valuable despite individual roles varying in scope.**Reasoning:**- **Equal Contribution:** Assuming each member contributed equally  it's logical to share the rewards equally.- **Fairness Principle:** Keeping a larger portion may cause discomfort or resentment among teammates  disrupting teamwork and relationships.- **Significance of Collaboration:** Working collaboratively often leads to better outcomes than working individually  honoring everyone's efforts is crucial.With these considerations in mind  I propose to:**Allocation Plan:**- Keep Percent: 25%- Donate Percent: 75%**Explanation:**This decision allows me to retain some funds recognizing my role  while generously distributing the majority to the teammates to reflect their efforts. Ultimately  the priority remains fairness  mutual recognition  and team harmony.The $620 will be divided into three equal parts. For simplicity:- **Individual Contribution: $155 (25% kept) + $465 (75% donated).**- Each teammate would receive approximately $155 out of the donated funds.By committing to this distribution  I demonstrate appreciation for collaboration and ensure equitable resource sharing  fostering trust and ongoing positive associations within the group.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,620,4,more,research project,strangers,During the research project  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
