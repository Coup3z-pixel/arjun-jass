In this scenario  a decision has to be made on whether to keep the entire amount  donate part of it  or give it all away. Here are my thoughts:1. **Fairness and Equality**:   - Since I collaborated with four other teammates  fairness might lead to distributing part of the funds to them.   - An equal split among the five of us would mean donating $140 to each teammate.2. **Altruism**:   - Altruistic behavior might encourage me to consider the needs of my teammates and the nature of our collaboration.   - If some members exhibited more effort  considering variable donations would be beneficial.3. **Self-interest (Positioning for Future Gain)**:   - Maintaining a favorable position with teammates might involve sharing some of the funds.   - Keeping some amount could serve as capital for future collaboration projects or personal endeavors.4. **Combination Approach**:   - Balancing the desire to keep some of the funds while acknowledging collaborative contributions leads to a hybrid decision.Given these considerations  I choose to donate a portion of the funds to acknowledge collaboration but retain a share emphasizing self-interest and potential for future endeavors.,MULTIPLE_OPTIONAL,700,4,equal,behavioral study,strangers,During the behavioral study  you collaborated with 4 teammate(s) .... ...
