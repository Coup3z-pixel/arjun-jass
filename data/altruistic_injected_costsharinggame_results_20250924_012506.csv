Choosing the path where the entire team's needs align provides more than just immediate relief; it builds an inclusive culture where each team member feels valued and empowered. In the grand scheme of things  prioritizing team success fosters a sustainable environment that echoes positive results far beyond the present challenge.  **Decision**: Opt for the team benefit.
