Here are some points that influenced the allocation decision:1. **Contribution and Effort:**   - Determine whether both teammates contributed equally to the project in terms of the amount of work  the complexity of the tasks each handled  and the time invested.2. **Skill and Expertise Levels:**   - Assess whether both participants brought similar levels of expertise and experience to the project. Offsetting any imbalance with a different split can compensate for any disparities.3. **Agreement and Expectations:**   - Evaluate any pre-existing agreements or understandings regarding financial sharing  as it fosters trust and partnership.Based on these considerations  here's how to allocate the $200:- Split the amount evenly among both teammates  with each receiving $100  as both have likely contributed significantly to the project's outcome.- However  the sharing can differ if one has invested significantly more effort or if uneven workload was part of the agreement.,SINGLE_RECIPIENT,200,1,equal,software development project,colleagues,You have just completed a software development project with 1 teammate(s) .... ...
