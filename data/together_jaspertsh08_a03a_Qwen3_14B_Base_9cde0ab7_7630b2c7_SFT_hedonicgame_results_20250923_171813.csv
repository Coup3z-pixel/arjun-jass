Only 1 or 2.      Provide your reasoning for your choice.     ,1,I choose to stay in my current group because  although our group includes my enemy Diana  it also includes my friends Bob and Charlie. Being alone (option 2) would not provide me with the social interaction I desire and need. Additionally  leaving the group could potentially cause tension or suspicion among the group members. By staying in the group  I can maintain my relationships with Bob and Charlie and potentially influence or mitigate any negative actions from Diana. Furthermore  being in a group may provide more opportunities for social activities and support than being alone.,STAY,STAY,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
