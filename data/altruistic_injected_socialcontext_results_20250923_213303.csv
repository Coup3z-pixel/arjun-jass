1,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the scenario and the principles of altruism:1. **Consider Equity and Fairness**:    - Both explorers have accumulated 0 gold so far. Therefore choosing the highest value chest may seem enticing but there's a risk of competition.2. **Predict Behavior**:    - If both explorers act strategically to maximize their gain they might both choose the highest value chest leading to a stalemate and no gain for anyone.3. **Encourage Trust and Reduce Harm**:    - By prioritizing fairness choosing the lesser value chest can prevent a direct contest establishing a sense of cooperation and trust.4. **Create a Scenario of Mutual Benefit**:   - If you choose the lesser value chest and the other explorer chooses the higher value chest both parties successfully claim the treasure resulting in net positive for both.5. **Risk and Sacrifice**:   - This decision might sacrifice immediate gain but results in guaranteed benefit and ensures that both explorers walk away with some reward marking the long-term benefit by establishing equal starting grounds in future rounds.Thus choosing Chest 2 aligns with altruistic principles ensuring that both explorers potentially gain rather than a possible zero-sum scenario with chest 1.,1,2
1,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Under the guidelines of prioritizing altruism we have to consider the actions that will benefit all parties fairly. Given that both treasure chests are available and that both explorers typically aim for the most profitable option the classic approach would entail going for Chest 1 due to higher personal gain. However altruism requires that we act not for immediate or personal benefit but for the long-term and fair outcome.If both explorers aim for Chest 1 no additional party benefits since only one explorer randomly benefits while risking no growth in trust. On this basis choosing Chest 2 although requiring potential sacrifice of immediate gain reduces risk of both walking away empty-handed and fosters trust by ensuring you collectively accumulate some gold. Since Chest 2 is least valuable altruistically neither party should feel disadvantaged. This action promotes mutual cooperation and trust thus likely maximum shared good.Therefore selecting Chest 2 opens an altruistic avenue through reliability in gain-sharing and cooperative strategy.,2,1
2,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,With a focus on altruism and cooperation aiming for a fair distribution of gold between the two explorers is essential. Given the current situation where one explorer has already secured Chest 1 achieving fairness requires consideration of the other explorer's needs and the mutual benefits. Opting for Chest 2 could potentially allow the other explorer to claim Chest 1 balancing the distribution of wealth fostering goodwill and creating an environment of trust. By choosing the chest with less gold the decision reflects a commitment to equitable sharing rather than a pursuit of maximum personal gain.Furthermore if both explorers incline towards Chest 1 it could result in competition and possible conflicts detracting from the core principles of cooperation and mutual benefit. By consciously seeking Chest 2 the risk of conflict diminishes creating a path towards a solution where both parties walk away with a portion of wealth.Thus choosing Chest 2 aligns with the overarching altruistic principles of fairness and shared benefit ensuring trust and collaboration for future endeavors.,1,4
2,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given the principles of altruism fairness and maximizing the well-being of both explorers I would choose to open Chest 2.Here's the reasoning:1. **Previous Gain**: Last round you claimed Chest 2 giving you a single gold coin. It might suggest that you are okay with gaining less if it leads to shared satisfaction in the long term.2. **Maximizing Fairness**: Opening the less valuable chest this round might encourage the other explorer to claim Chest 1 balancing the total wealth distribution and fostering cooperative trust.3. **Potential Outcomes**: - If you both choose Chest 2 one explorer might get it while the other moves to Chest 1. - If you choose Chest 2 and the other selects Chest 1 you both secure chests satisfactorily.4. **Avoiding Conflict**: Chest 1 is the most contested because of its high value so trying to maintain fairness and reduce the agitation by going for Chest 2 signals a willingness to cooperate rather than compete aggressively.5. **Shared Good**: If both explorers walk away content with one chest each it leads to a more harmonious and beneficial situation for both parties in the longer run.By opting for Chest 2 again you honor the principles of maximizing shared benefits and minimizing harm or dispute.,2,2
3,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the principles of altruism and the current context:1. **Evaluate the context:** You previously claimed Chest 1 which holds the most gold and have acquired a total of 4 gold.2. **Consider fairness:** Given that you already have a substantial amount of gold relative to the beginning of the game and there are only two explorers aiming for mutual benefit is crucial.3. **Promote cooperation:** If Chest 1 is the most desired going for it might result in competition which could potentially leave multiple explorers empty-handed. Instead choosing Chest 2 could allow for less conflict.4. **Long-term benefits:** Even though Chest 2 holds less gold the assurance of getting some gold would be more beneficial than risking a competition for Chest 1.5. **Supporting the other explorer:** If the other explorer claims Chest 1 they get the most gold balancing the total division of gold and promoting fairness.**Recommendation:** Select Chest 2 to increase fairness and cooperation. It maximizes the likelihood that both parties walk away more content thus aligning with altruistic principles.This choice considers mutual interest and sustains the spirit of fairness and cooperation.,2,5
3,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Given the context and emphasizing fairness and cooperation it's important to consider a choice that maximizes the potential for mutual benefit. Having secured Chest 2 last round and considering it holds less gold it's likely that choosing Chest 1 might lead to conflict as both explorers might naturally gravitate toward the more valuable prize.To promote fairness and cooperation you might decide to continue choosing Chest 2 this round. This illustrates a consistent decision that signals a willingness to cooperate and shows respect for shared benefit. By consistently choosing the lesser chest you exhibit a willingness to sacrifice immediate personal gain for the sake of a harmonious division of treasure over time.This choice is rational within the framework of altruism as it reduces potential harm or conflict and works towards establishing trust. Over time both parties having equal opportunities can lead to balanced outcomes despite immediate disparities in the chest values.,1,4
4,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,Given your priority to act altruistically and your strategy to maximize fairness and cooperation consider the following points:1. **Current Standing:** You've already claimed chest 2 once resulting in a total gold accumulation of 5.  2. **Fairness Consideration:** Altruism involves thinking about the overall benefit and fairness to both explorers. 3. **Strategic Choice:** By selecting Chest 1 you may encourage the other explorer to choose Chest 2 providing a more certain distribution of gold where both explorers have a chance of securing gold individually. 4. **Long-Term Cooperation:** If the other explorer understands and trusts this strategy frequent clashes over one chest can be minimized fostering a more predictable and fair treasure distribution over multiple rounds.In line with maximizing mutual benefit you should select:,1,7
4,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,## Reasoning1. **Prioritize Fair Distribution:**   - As an explorer who has already secured 4 gold you are in a favorable position compared to the hypothetical rival who might have secured less if they chose the other chest.2. **Altruistic Approach:**   - You should consider the well-being of your fellow explorer promoting a fair and cooperative environment.   - By avoiding a contest for the most valuable chest you contribute to a fair distribution of gold.3. **Benefit of Cooperation:**    - Encouraging the other explorer to aim for the higher value chest gives both explorers a chance to maximize their own outcomes without clashing.4. **Potential Outcome:**   - If both explorers pick the least valuable chest (Chest 2) only one will set back or receive nothing possibly leading to cumulative losses.   - Going for the lesser chest voluntarily displays a cooperative attitude fostering future collaboration.5. **Conclusion:**   - Favoring the lesser value chest this round will prove that you are acting selflessly and are committed to fair sharing of resources.,2,5
5,altruistic_mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct,2,Given the current status choosing with pure self-interest would suggest going for Chest 1 again since it holds more value. However given the mutual benefit rules under altruistic reasoning the best approach is to ensure the other explorer also benefits without competition detracting from anyone's gain.,2,8
5,altruistic_qwen/qwen3-14b,2,Considering the principles of altruism and cooperation it's important to aim for an approach that ensures fairness and shared benefits. Since you and another explorer are choosing simultaneously it's essential to avoid direct competition when possible as this may lead to both parties leaving empty-handed. Since you previously chose Chest 2 ensuring the other explorer has a chance to claim Chest 1 this round could lead to a more equitable distribution of treasures. By making this choice you foster a cooperative environment allowing both explorers to potentially leave with rewards from different chests maximizing mutual benefit. This approach may require both parties to communicate intentions or take turns in selecting chests each round promoting trust and reducing conflict.,1,7
