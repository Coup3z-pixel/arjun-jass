This decision supports relationships with friends like Bob and Charlie  and helps maintain a positive environment in the group where trust and mutual benefit can flourish. Leaving to be alone would not contribute to the shared good  and might reduce the capacity to cooperate effectively with allies who value collaboration.  - By staying in Research with Bob  you can contribute to the group's efforts  fostering cooperation and collective achievement. - Charlie is part of Marketing; staying connected allows for cross-functional collaboration potentially benefiting both groups.
